    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      These stories originally appeared in two volumes, the first in 1884, the
      second in 1886. The latter part of the present edition is thus separated
      from the first part by a lapse of two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg&rsquo;s views were continually undergoing changes. Constancy was
      never a trait of his. He himself tells us that opinions are but the
      reflection of a man&rsquo;s experiences, changing as his experiences change. In
      the two years following the publication of the first volume, Strindberg&rsquo;s
      experiences were such as to exercise a decisive influence on his views on
      the woman question and to transmute his early predisposition to
      woman-hating from a passive tendency to a positive, active force in his
      character and writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg&rsquo;s art in <i>Married</i> is of the propagandist, of the fighter
      for a cause. He has a lesson to convey and he makes frankly for his goal
      without attempting to conceal his purpose under the gloss of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; art.
      He chooses the story form in preference to the treatise as a more powerful
      medium to drive home his ideas. That the result has proved successful is
      due to the happy admixture in Strindberg of thinker and artist. His
      artist&rsquo;s sense never permitted him to distort or misrepresent the truth
      for the sake of proving his theories. In fact, he arrived at his theories
      not as a scholar through the study of books, but as an artist through the
      experience of life. When life had impressed upon him what seemed to him a
      truth, he then applied his intellect to it to bolster up that truth. Hence
      it is that, however opinionated Strindberg may at times seem, his writings
      carry that conviction which we receive only when the author reproduces&rsquo; 
      truths he has obtained first-hand from life. One-sided he may occasionally
      be in <i>Married</i>, especially in the later stories, but rarely
      unfaithful. His manner is often to throw such a glaring searchlight upon
      one spot of life that all the rest of it stays in darkness; but the places
      he does show up are never unimportant or trivial. They are well worth
      seeing with Strindberg&rsquo;s brilliant illumination thrown upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      August Strindberg has left a remarkably rich record of his life in various
      works, especially in his autobiographical series of novels. He was born in
      1849 in Stockholm. His was a sad childhood passed in extreme poverty. He
      succeeded in entering the University of Upsala in 1867, but was forced for
      a time on account of lack of means to interrupt his studies. He tried his
      fortune as schoolmaster, actor, and journalist and made an attempt to
      study medicine. All the while he was active in a literary way, composing
      his first plays in 1869. In 1874 he obtained a position in the Royal
      Library, where he devoted himself to scientific studies, learned Chinese
      in order to catalogue the Chinese manuscripts, and wrote an erudite
      monograph which was read at the Academy of Inscriptions in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first important literary productions were the drama <i>Master Olof</i>
      (1878) and the novel <i>The Red Room</i> (1879). Disheartened by the
      failure of <i>Master Olof</i>, he gave up literature for a long time. When
      he returned to it, he displayed an amazing productivity. Work followed
      work in quick succession&mdash;novels, short stories, dramas, histories,
      historical studies, and essays. <i>The Swedish People</i> is said to be
      the most popular book in Sweden next to the Bible. The mere enumeration of
      his writings would occupy more than two pages. His versatility led him to
      make researches in physics and chemistry and natural science and to write
      on those subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through works like <i>The Red Room</i>, <i>Married</i>, and the dramas <i>The
      Father</i> and <i>Miss Julia</i>, Strindberg attached himself to the
      naturalistic school of literature. Another period of literary inactivity
      followed, during which he passed through a mental crisis akin to insanity.
      When he returned to the writing of novels and dramas he was no longer a
      naturalist, but a symbolist and mystic. Among the plays he composed in
      this style are <i>To Damascus</i>, <i>The Dream Play</i>, and <i>The Great
      Highway</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strindberg married three times, divorced his first two wives, but
      separated amicably from the third. He died in 1913. The vast demonstration
      at his funeral, attended by the laboring classes as well as by the &ldquo;upper&rdquo;
       classes, proved that, in spite of the antagonisms he had aroused, Sweden
      unanimously awarded him the highest place in her literature.

    <h2>
      ASRA
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had just completed his thirteenth year when his mother died. He felt
      that he had lost a real friend, for during the twelve months of her
      illness he had come to know her personally, as it were, and established a
      relationship between them which is rare between parents and children. He
      was a clever boy and had developed early; he had read a great many books
      besides his schoolbooks, for his father, a professor of botany at the
      Academy of Science, possessed a very good library. His mother, on the
      other hand, was not a well-educated woman; she had merely been head
      housekeeper and children&rsquo;s nurse in her husband&rsquo;s house. Numerous births
      and countless vigils (she had not slept through a single night for the
      last sixteen years), had exhausted her strength, and when she became
      bedridden, at the age of thirty-nine, and was no longer able to look after
      her house, she made the acquaintance of her second son; her eldest boy was
      at a military school and only at home during the week ends. Now that her
      part as mother of the family was played to the end and nothing remained of
      her but a poor invalid, the old-fashioned relationship of strict
      discipline, that barrier between parents and children, was superseded. The
      thirteen-year-old son was almost constantly at her bedside, reading to her
      whenever he was not at school or doing home lessons. She had many
      questions to ask and he had a great deal to explain, and therefore all
      those distinguishing marks erected by age and position vanished, one after
      the other: if there was a superior at all, it was the son. But the mother,
      too, had much to teach, for she had learnt her lessons in the school of
      life; and so they were alternately teacher and pupil. They discussed all
      subjects. With the tact of a mother and the modesty of the other sex she
      told her son all he ought to know of the mystery of life. He was still
      innocent, but he had heard many things discussed by the boys at school
      which had shocked and disgusted him. The mother explained to him all she
      could explain; warned him of the greatest danger to a young man, and
      exacted a promise from him never to visit a house of ill-fame, not even
      out of curiosity, because, as she pointed out, in such a case no man could
      ever trust himself. And she implored him to live a temperate life, and
      turn to God in prayer whenever temptation assaulted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was entirely devoted to science, which was a sealed book to his
      wife. When the mother was already on the point of death, he made a
      discovery which he hoped would make his name immortal in the scientific
      world. He discovered, on a rubbish heap, outside the gates of Stockholm, a
      new kind of goose-foot with curved hairs on the usually straight-haired
      calyx. He was in communication with the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and
      the latter was even now considering the advisability of including the new
      variety in the &ldquo;Flora Germanica&rdquo;; he was daily expecting to hear whether
      or not the Academy had decided to immortalise his name by calling the
      plant Chenopodium Wennerstroemianium. At his wife&rsquo;s death-bed he was
      absentminded, almost unkind, for he had just received an answer in the
      affirmative, and he fretted because neither he nor his wife could enjoy
      the great news. She thought only of heaven and her children. He could not
      help realising that to talk to her now of a calyx with curved hairs would
      be the height of absurdity; but, he justified himself, it was not so much
      a question of a calyx with straight or curved hairs, as of a scientific
      discovery; and, more than that, it was a question of his future and the
      future of his children, for their father&rsquo;s distinction meant bread for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife died on the following evening, he cried bitterly; he had not
      shed a tear for many years. He was tortured by remorse, remembered even
      the tiniest wrong he had ever done her, for he had been, on the whole, an
      exemplary husband; his indifference, his absent-mindedness of the previous
      day, filled him with shame and regret, and in a moment of blankness he
      realised all the pettishness and selfishness of his science which, he had
      imagined, was benefiting mankind. But these emotions were short-lived; if
      you open a door with a spring behind it, it will close again immediately.
      On the following morning, after he had drawn up an announcement of her
      death for the papers, he wrote a letter of thanks to the Berlin Academy of
      Sciences. After that he resumed his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home to dinner, he longed for his wife, so that he might tell
      her of his success, for she had always been his truest friend, the only
      human being who had never been jealous or envious. Now he missed this
      loyal companion on whose approval he could count as a matter of course;
      never once had she contradicted him, for since he never told her more than
      the practical result of his researches, there was no room for argument.
      For a moment the thought occurred to him that he might make friends with
      his son; but they knew each other too little; their relationship was that
      of officer and private soldier. His superior rank did not permit him to
      make advances; moreover, he regarded the boy with suspicion, because the
      latter possessed a keener intellect and had read a number of new books
      which were unknown to him; occasionally it even happened that the father,
      the professor, plainly revealed his ignorance to his son, the school-boy.
      In such cases the father was either compelled to dismiss the argument,
      with a few contemptuous remarks to &ldquo;these new follies,&rdquo; or peremptorily
      order the school-boy to attend to his lessons. Once or twice, in
      self-defence, the son had produced one or other of his school-books; the
      professor had lost his temper and wished the new school-books to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that the father devoted himself to his collections of
      dried plants and the son went his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lived in a quiet street to the left of the Observatory, in a small,
      one-storey house, built of bricks, and surrounded by a large garden; the
      garden was once the property of the Horticultural Society, and had come
      into the professor&rsquo;s possession by inheritance. But since he studied
      descriptive botany, and took no interest in the much more interesting
      subjects of the physiology and morphology of plants, a science which was
      as good as unknown in his youth, he was practically a stranger to living
      nature. He allowed the garden with its many splendours to become a
      wilderness, and finally let it to a gardener on condition that he and his
      children should be allowed certain privileges. The son used the garden as
      a park and enjoyed its beauty as he found it, without taking the trouble
      to try and understand it scientifically.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might compare the boy&rsquo;s character to an ill-proportioned compensation
      pendulum; it contained too much of the soft metal of the mother, not
      enough of the hard metal of the father. Friction and irregular
      oscillations were the natural consequences. Now he was full of sentiment,
      now hard and sceptical. His mother&rsquo;s death affected him beyond words. He
      mourned her deeply, and she always lived in his memory as the
      personification of all that was good and great and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasted the summer following her death in brooding and novel-reading.
      Grief, and to no small extent idleness, had shaken his whole nervous
      system and quickened his imagination. His tears had been like warm April
      showers falling on fruit trees, wakening them to a precocious burgeoning:
      but alas! only too often the blossoms are doomed to wither and perish in a
      frosty May night, before the fruit has had time to set.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fifteen years old and had therefore arrived at the age when
      civilised man attains to manhood and is ripe to give life to a new
      generation, but is prevented from doing so by his inability to maintain a
      family. Consequently he was about to begin the ten years&rsquo; martyrdom which
      a young man is called upon to endure in the struggle against an
      overwhelming force of nature, before he is in a position to fulfil her
      laws.

    <p>
      It is a warm afternoon about Whitsuntide. The appletrees are gorgeous in
      their white splendour which nature has showered all over them with a
      profuse hand. The breeze shakes the crowns and fills the air with pollen;
      a part of it fulfils its destination and creates new life, a part sinks to
      the ground and dies. What is a handful of pollen more or less in the
      inexhaustible store-house of nature! The fertilised blossom casts off its
      delicate petals which flutter to the ground and wither; they decay in the
      rain and are ground to dust, to rise again through the sap and re-appear
      as blossoms, and this time, perhaps, to become fruit. But now the struggle
      begins: those which a kind fate has placed on the sunny side, thrive and
      prosper; the seed bud swells, and if no frost intervenes, the fruit, in
      due time, will set. But those which look towards the North, the poor
      things which grow in the shadow of the others and never see the sun, are
      predestined to fade and fall off; the gardener rakes them together and
      carts them to the pig-sty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold the apple-tree now, its branches laden with half-ripe fruit,
      little, round, golden apples with rosy cheeks. A fresh struggle begins: if
      all remain alive, the branches will not be able to bear their weight, the
      tree will perish. A gale shakes the branches. It requires firm stems to
      hold on. Woe to the weaklings! they are condemned to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh danger! The apple-weevil appears upon the scene. It, too, has to
      maintain life and to fulfil a duty towards its progeny. The grub eats its
      way through the fruit to the stem and the apple falls to the ground. But
      the dainty beetle chooses the strongest and soundest for its brood,
      otherwise too many of the strong ones would be allowed to live, and
      competition would become over-keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of twilight, the gathering dusk, arouses the passionate instincts
      of the beast-world. The night-crow crouches on the newly-dug flower-bed to
      lure its mate. Which of the eager males shall carry the prize? Let them
      decide the question!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat, sleek and warm, fresh from her evening milk, steals away from her
      corner by the hearth and picks her way carefully among daffodils and
      lilies, afraid lest the dew make her coat damp and ragged before her lover
      joins her. She sniffs at the young lavender and calls. Her call is
      answered by the black tom-cat which appears, broad-backed like a marten,
      on the neighbour&rsquo;s fence; but the gardener&rsquo;s tortoise-shell approaches
      from the cow-shed and the fight begins. Handfuls of the rich, black soil
      are flying about in all directions, and the newly-planted radishes and
      spinach plants are roughly awakened from their quiet sleep and dreams of
      the future. The stronger of the two remains in possession of the field,
      and the female awaits complacently the frenetic embraces of the victor.
      The vanquished flies to engage in a new struggle in which, perhaps,
      victory will smile on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature smiles, content, for she knows of no other sin than the sin against
      her law; she is on the side of the strong for her desire is for strong
      children, even though she should have to kill the &ldquo;eternal ego&rdquo; of the
      insignificant individual. And there is no prudery, no hesitation, no fear
      of consequences, for nature has plenty of food for all her children&mdash;except
      mankind.

      After supper he went for a walk in the garden while his father sat down at
      his bed-room window to smoke a pipe and read the evening paper. He
      strolled along the paths, revelling in the delicious odours which a plant
      only exhales when it is in full bloom, and which is the finest and
      strongest extract of etheric oils, containing in a condensed form the full
      strength of the individual, destined to become the representative of the
      species. He listened to the nuptial song of the insects above the lime
      trees, which rings in our ears like a funeral dirge: he heard the purring
      call of the night-crow; the ardent mewing of the cat, which sounds as if
      death, and not life, were wooing; the humming note of the dung-beetle, the
      fluttering of the large moths, the thin peeping of the bats.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped before a bed of narcissus, gathered one of the while, starry
      flowers, and inhaled its perfume until he felt the blood hammering in his
      temples. He had never examined this flower minutely. But during the last
      term they had read Ovid&rsquo;s story of Narcissus. He had not discovered a
      deeper meaning in the legend. What did it mean, this story of a youth who,
      from unrequited love, turned his ardour upon himself and was consumed by
      the flame when he fell in love with his own likeness seen in a well? As he
      stood, examining the white, cup-shaped petals, pale as the cheeks of an
      invalid with fine red lines such as one may see in the faces of
      consumptives when a pitiless cough forces the blood into the extremest and
      tiniest blood-vessels, he thought of a school-fellow, a young aristocrat,
      who was a midshipman now; he looked like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had inhaled the scent of the flower for some time, the strong
      odour of cloves disappeared and left but a disagreeable, soapy smell which
      made him feel sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sauntered on to where the path turned to the right and finally lost
      itself in an avenue planted on both sides with elm-trees whose branches
      had grown together and formed an arch overhead. In the semi-darkness, far
      down the perspective, he could see a large green swing, suspended by
      ropes, slowly moving backwards and forwards. A girl stood on the back
      board, gently swinging herself by bending her knees and throwing her body
      forward, while she clung, with arms raised high above her head, to the
      ropes at her side. He recognised the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, a girl who had
      been confirmed last Easter and had just begun to wear long skirts.
      To-night, however, she was dressed in one of her old dresses which barely
      reached to her ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the young man embarrassed her, for she remembered the
      shortness of her skirt, but she nevertheless remained on the swing. He
      advanced and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, Mr. Theodore,&rdquo; said the girl, giving the swing a vigorous push.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; answered the youth, who felt the draught of her fluttering
      skirts on his throbbing temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want you to,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me come up, too, and I&rsquo;ll swing you, Gussie,&rdquo; pleaded Theodore,
      springing on to the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was standing on the swing, facing her. And when they rose into the
      air, he felt her skirts flapping against his legs, and when they
      descended, he bent over her and looked into her eyes which were brilliant
      with fear and enjoyment. Her thin cotton blouse fitted tightly and showed
      every line of her young figure; her smiling lips were half-open,
      displaying two rows of sound white teeth, which looked as if they would
      like to bite or kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher and higher rose the swing, until it struck the topmost branches of
      the maple. The girl screamed and fell forward, into his arms; he was
      pushed over, on to the seat. The trembling of the soft warm body which
      nestled closely in his arms, sent an electric shock through his whole
      nervous system; a black veil descended before his eyes and he would have
      let her go if her left shoulder had not been tightly pressed against his
      right arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed of the swing slackened. She rose and sat on the seat facing him.
      And thus they remained with downcast eyes, not daring to look one another
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the swing stopped, the girl slipped off the seat and ran away as if
      she were answering a call. Theodore was left alone. He felt the blood
      surging in his veins. It seemed to him that his strength was redoubled.
      But he could not grasp what had happened. He vaguely conceived himself as
      an electrophor whose positive electricity, in discharging, had combined
      with the negative. It had happened during a quite ordinary, to all
      appearances chaste, contact with a young woman. He had never felt the same
      emotion in wrestling, for instance, with his school-fellows in the
      play-ground. He had come into contact with the opposite polarity of the
      female sex and now he knew what it meant to be a man. For he was a man,
      not a precocious boy, kicking over the traces; he was a strong, hardy,
      healthy youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he strolled along, up and down the garden paths, new thoughts formed in
      his brain. Life looked at him with graver eyes, he felt conscious of a
      sense of duty. But he was only fifteen years old. He was not yet confirmed
      and many years would have to elapse before he would be considered an
      independent member of the community, before he would be able to earn a
      living for himself, let alone maintain a wife and family. He took life
      seriously, the thought of light adventures never occurred to him. Women
      were to him something sacred, his opposite pole, the supplement and
      completion of himself. He was mature now, bodily and mentally, fit to
      enter the arena of life and fight his way. What prevented him from doing
      so? His education, which had taught him nothing useful; his social
      position, which stood between him and a trade he might have learned. The
      Church, which had not yet received his vow of loyalty to her priests; the
      State, which was still waiting for his oath of allegiance to Bernadotte
      and Nassau; the School, which had not yet trained him sufficiently to
      consider him ripe for the University; the secret alliance of the upper
      against the lower classes. A whole mountain of follies lay on him and his
      young strength. Now that he knew himself to be a man, the whole system of
      education seemed to him an institution for the mutilation of body and
      soul. They must both be mutilated before he could be allowed to enter the
      harem of the world, where manhood is considered a danger; he could find no
      other excuse for it. And thus he sank back into his former state of
      immaturity. He compared himself to a celery plant, tied up and put under a
      flower-pot so as to make it as white and soft as possible, unable to put
      forth green leaves in the sunshine, flower, and bear seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in these thoughts he remained in the garden until the clock on the
      nearest church tower struck ten. Then he turned towards the house, for it
      was bed-time. But the front door was locked. The house-maid, a petticoat
      thrown over her nightgown, let him in. A glimpse of her bare shoulders
      roused him from his sentimental reveries; he tried to put his arm round
      her and kiss her, for at the moment he was conscious of nothing but her
      sex. But the maid had already disappeared, shutting the door with a bang.
      Overwhelmed with shame he opened his window, cooled his head in a basin of
      cold water and lighted his lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had got into bed, he took up a volume of Arndt&rsquo;s <i>Spiritual
      Voices of the Morning</i>, a book which had belonged to his mother; he
      read a chapter of it every evening to be on the safe side, for in the
      morning his time was short. The book reminded him of the promise of
      chastity given to his mother on her death-bed, and he felt a twinge of
      conscience. A fly which had singed its wings on his lamp, and was now
      buzzing round the little table by his bedside, turned his thoughts into
      another channel; he closed the book and lit a cigarette. He heard his
      father take off his boots in the room below, knock out his pipe against
      the stove, pour out a glass of water and get ready to go to bed. He
      thought how lonely he must be since he had become a widower. In days gone
      by he had often heard the subdued voices of his parents through the thin
      partition, in intimate conversation on matters on which they always
      agreed; but now no voice was audible, nothing but the dead sounds which a
      man makes in waiting upon himself, sounds which one must put side by side,
      like the figures in a rebus, before one can understand their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his cigarette, blew out the lamp and said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in
      an undertone, but he got no farther than the fifth petition. Then he fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke from a dream in the middle of the night. He had dreamt that he
      held the gardener&rsquo;s daughter in his arms. He could not remember the
      circumstances, for he was quite dazed, and fell asleep again directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he was depressed and had a headache. He brooded
      over the future which loomed before him threateningly and filled him with
      dread. He realised with a pang how quickly the summer was passing, for the
      end of the summer meant the degradation of school-life. Every thought of
      his own would be stifled by the thoughts of others; there was no advantage
      in being able to think independently; it required a fixed number of years
      before one could reach one&rsquo;s goal. It was like a journey on a good&rsquo;s
      train; the engine was bound to remain for a certain time in the stations,
      and when the pressure of the steam became too strong, from want of
      consumption of energy, a waste-pipe had to be opened. The Board had drawn
      up the time-table and the train was not permitted to arrive at the
      stations before its appointed time. That was the principal thing which
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father noticed the boy&rsquo;s pallor, but he put it down to grief over his
      mother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn came and with it the return to school. Theodore, by dint of much
      novel-reading during the summer, and coming in this way, as it were, in
      constant contact with grown-up people and their problems and struggles,
      had come to look upon himself as a grown-up member of society. Now the
      masters treated him with familiarity, the boys took liberties which
      compelled him to repay them in kind. And this educational institution,
      which was to ennoble him and make him fit to take his place in the
      community, what did it teach him? How did it ennoble him? The compendiums,
      one and all, were written under the control of the upper classes, for the
      sole purpose of forcing the lower classes to look up to their betters. The
      schoolmasters frequently reproached their pupils with ingratitude and
      impressed on them their utter inability to realise, even faintly, the
      advantage they enjoyed in receiving an education which so many of their
      poorer fellow-creatures would always lack. No, indeed, the boys were not
      sophisticated enough to see through the gigantic fraud and its advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did they ever find true joy, real pleasure in the subjects of their
      studies for their own sakes? Never! Therefore the teachers had to appeal
      incessantly to the lower passions of their pupils, to ambition,
      self-interest, material advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a miserable make-believe school was! Not one of the boys believed
      that he would reap any benefit from repeating the names and dates of hated
      kings in their proper sequence, from learning dead languages, proving
      axioms, defining &ldquo;a matter of course,&rdquo; and counting the anthers of plants
      and the joints on the hindlegs of insects, to knowing the end no more
      about them than their Latin names. How many long hours were wasted in the
      vain attempt to divide an angle into three equal sections, a thing which
      can be done so easily in a minute in an <i>unscientific</i> (that is to
      say practical) way by using a graduator.
    </p>
    <p>
      How they scorned everything practical! His sisters, who were taught French
      from Ollendorf&rsquo;s grammar, were able to speak the language after two years&rsquo; 
      study; but the college boys could not say a single sentence after six.
      Ollendorf was a name which they pronounced with pity and contempt. It was
      the essence of all that was stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when his sister asked for an explanation and enquired whether the
      purpose of spoken language was not the expression of human thought, the
      young sophist replied with a phrase picked up from one of the masters who
      in his turn had borrowed it from Talleyrand. Language was invented to hide
      one&rsquo;s thoughts. This, of course, was beyond the horizon of a young girl
      (how well men know how to hide their shortcomings), but henceforth she
      believed her brother to be tremendously learned, and stopped arguing with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And was there not even a worse stumbling-block in aesthetics, delusive and
      deceptive, casting a veil of borrowed splendour and sham beauty over
      everything? They sang of &ldquo;The Knights&rsquo; Vigil of Light.&rdquo; What knights&rsquo; 
      vigil? With patents of nobility and students&rsquo; certificates; false
      testimonials, as they might have told themselves. Of light? That was to
      say of the upper classes who had the greatest interest in keeping the
      lower classes in darkness, a task in which they were ably assisted by
      church and school. &ldquo;And onward, onward, on the path of light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Things were always called by the wrong name. And if it so happened that a
      light-bearer arose from the lower classes, everybody was ready and
      prepared to extinguish his torch. Oh! youthful, healthy host of fighters!
      How healthy they were, all these young men, enervated by idleness,
      unsatisfied desires and ambitions, who scorned every man who had not the
      means to pay for a University education! What splendid liars they were,
      the poets of the upper classes! Were they the deceivers or the deceived?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the usual subject of the young men&rsquo;s conversation? Their studies?
      Never! Once in a way, perhaps, they would talk of certificates. No, their
      conversation was of things obscene; of appointments with women; of
      billiards and drink; of certain diseases which they had heard discussed by
      their elder brothers. They lounged about in the afternoon and &ldquo;held the
      reviews,&rdquo; and the best informed of them knew the name of the officer and
      could tell the others where his mistress lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once two members of the &ldquo;Knights&rsquo; Vigil of Light,&rdquo; had dined in the
      company of two women on the terrace of a high-class restaurant in the
      Zoological Gardens. For this offence they were expelled from school. They
      were punished for their naïveté, not because their conduct was considered
      vicious, for a year after they passed their examinations and went to the
      University, gaining in this way a whole year; and when they had completed
      their studies at Upsala, they were attached to the Embassy in one of the
      capitals of Europe, to represent the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these surroundings Theodore spent the best part of his youth. He had
      seen through the fraud, but was compelled to acquiesce! Again and again he
      asked himself the question: What can I do? There was no answer. And so he
      became an accessory and learned to hold his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      His confirmation appeared to him to be very much on a level with his
      school experience. A young minister, an ardent pietist, was to teach him
      in four months Luther&rsquo;s Catechism, regardless of the fact that he was well
      versed in theology, exegesis and dogmatics, besides having read the New
      Testament in Greek. Nevertheless the strict pietism, which demanded
      absolute truth in thought and action, could not fail to make a great
      impression on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the catechumens were assembled for the first time, Theodore found
      himself quite unexpectedly surrounded by a totally different class of boys
      to whom he had been used at school. When he entered the assembly-room he
      was met by the stare of something like a hundred inimical eyes. There were
      tobacco binders, chimney sweeps, apprentices of all trades. They were on
      bad terms and freely abused one another, but this enmity between the
      different trades was only superficial; however much they quarrelled, they
      yet held together. He seemed to breathe a strangely stifling atmosphere;
      the hatred with which they greeted him was not unmixed with contempt, the
      reverse of a certain respect or envy. He looked in vain for a friend, for
      a companion, like-minded, dressed as he was. There was not a single one.
      The parish was poor, the rich people sent their children to the German
      church which was then the fashion. It was in the company of the children
      of the people, the lower classes, that he was to approach the altar, as
      their equal. He asked himself what it was that separated him from these
      boys? Were they not, bodily, endowed with the same gifts as he? No doubt,
      for every one of them earned his living, and some of them helped to keep
      their parents. Were they less gifted, mentally? He did not think so, for
      their remarks gave evidence of keen powers of observation; he would have
      laughed at many of their witty remarks if he had not been conscious of his
      superior caste. There was no definite line of demarcation between him and
      the fools who were his school-fellows. But there was a line here Was it
      the shabby clothes, the plain faces, the coarse hands, which formed the
      barrier? Partly, he thought. Their plainness, especially, repulsed him.
      But were they worse than others because they were plain?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was carrying a foil, as he had a fencing lesson later on. He put it in
      a corner of the room, hoping that it would escape attention. But it had
      been seen already. Nobody knew what kind of a thing it really was, but
      everybody recognised it as a weapon of some sort. Some of the boldest
      busied themselves about the corner, so as to have a look at it. They
      fingered the covering of the handle, scratched the guard with their nails,
      bent the blade, handled the small leather ball. They were like hares
      sniffing at a gun which had been lost in the wood. They did not understand
      its use, but they knew it for something inimical, something with a hidden
      meaning. Presently a belt-maker&rsquo;s apprentice, whose brother was in the
      Life Guards, joined the inquisitive throng and at once decided the
      question: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that it is a sword, you fools?&rdquo; he shouted, with
      a look at Theodore. It was a respectful look, but a look which also hinted
      at a secret understanding between them, which, correctly interpreted,
      meant: You and I understand these things! But a young rope-maker, who had
      once been a trumpeter in a military band, considered this giving of a
      verdict without consulting him a personal slight and declared that he
      &ldquo;would be hanged if it wasn&rsquo;t a rapier!&rdquo; The consequence was a fight which
      transformed the place into a bear-garden, dense with dust and re-echoing
      with screams and yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and the minister stood on the threshold. He was a pale
      young man, very thin, with watery blue eyes and a face disfigured by a
      rash. He shouted at the boys. The wild beasts ceased fighting. He began
      talking of the precious blood of Christ and the power of the Evil One over
      the human heart. After a little while he succeeded in inducing the hundred
      boys to sit down on the forms and chairs. But now he was quite out of
      breath and the atmosphere was thick with dust. He glanced at the window
      and said in a faint voice: &ldquo;Open the sash!&rdquo; This request re-awakened the
      only half-subdued passions. Twenty-five boys made a rush for the window
      and tried to seize the window cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to your places at once!&rdquo; screamed the minister, stretching out his
      hand for his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary silence during which the minister tried to think of
      a way of having the sash raised without a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said at last to a timid little fellow, &ldquo;go and open the window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small boy went to the window and tried to disentangle the window cord.
      The others looked on in breathless silence, when suddenly a big lad, in
      sailor&rsquo;s clothes, who had just come home on the brig <i>Carl Johan</i>,
      lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take me if I don&rsquo;t show you what a lad can do,&rdquo; he shouted,
      throwing off his coat and jumping on the window sill; there was a flash
      from his cutlass and the rope was cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cable&rsquo;s cut!&rdquo; he laughed, as the minister with a hysterical cry,
      literally drove him to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rope was so entangled that there was nothing for it but to cut it,&rdquo;
       he assured him, as he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was furious. He had come from a small town in the provinces
      and had never conceived the possibility of so much sin, so much wickedness
      and immorality. He had never come into contact with lads so far advanced
      on the road to damnation. And he talked at great length of the precious
      blood of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of them understood what he said, for they did not realise that
      they had fallen, since they had never bee different. The boys received his
      words with coldness and indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister rambled on and spoke of Christ&rsquo;s precious wounds, but not one
      of them took his words to heart, for not one of them was conscious of
      having wounded Christ. He changed the subject and spoke of the devil, but
      that was a topic so familiar to them that it made no impression. At last
      he hit on the right thing. He began to talk of their confirmation which
      was to take place in the coming spring. He reminded them of their parents,
      anxious that their children should play a part in the life of the
      community; when he went on to speak of employers who refused to employ
      lads who had not been confirmed, his listeners became deeply interested at
      once, and every one of them understood the great importance of the coming
      ceremony. Now he was sincere, and the young minds grasped what he was
      talking about; the noisiest among them became quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The registration began. What a number of marriage certificates were
      missing! How could the children come to Christ when their parents had not
      been legally married? How could they approach the altar when their fathers
      had been in prison? Oh! what sinners they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore was deeply moved by the exhibition of so much shame and disgrace.
      He longed to tear his thoughts away from the subject, but was unable to do
      so. Now it was his turn to hand in his certificates and the minister read
      out: son: Theodore, born on such and such a date; parents: professor and
      knight ... a faint smile flickered like a feeble sunbeam over his face, he
      gave him a friendly nod and asked: &ldquo;And how is your dear father?&rdquo; But when
      he saw that the mother was dead (a fact of which he was perfectly well
      aware) his face clouded over. &ldquo;She was a child of God,&rdquo; he said, as if he
      were talking to himself, in a gushing, sympathetic, whining voice, but the
      remark conveyed at the same time a certain reproach against the &ldquo;dear
      father,&rdquo; who was only a professor and knight. After that Theodore could
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the assembly-room he felt that he had gone through an almost
      impossible experience. Were all those lads really depraved because they
      used oaths and coarse language, as his companions, his father, his uncle,
      and all the upper classes did at times? What did the minister mean when he
      talked of immorality? They were more savage than the spoilt children of
      the wealthy, but that was because they were more fully alive. It was
      unfair to blame them for missing marriage certificates. True, his father
      had never committed a theft, but there was no necessity for a man to steal
      if he had an income of six thousand crowns and could please himself. The
      act would be absurd or abnormal in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore went back to school realising what it meant &ldquo;to have received an
      education&rdquo;; here nobody was badgered for small faults. As little notice as
      possible was taken of one&rsquo;s own or one&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s weaknesses, one was
      among equals and understood one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      After school one &ldquo;held the reviews,&rdquo; sneaked into a cafe and drank a
      liqueur, and finally went to the fencing-room. He looked at the young
      officers who treated him as their equal, observed all those young bloods
      with their supple limbs, pleasant manners and smiling faces, every one of
      them certain that a good dinner was awaiting him at home, and became
      conscious of the existence of two worlds: an upper and an under-world. He
      remembered the gloomy assembly-room and the wretched assembly he had just
      left with a pang; all their wounds and hidden defects were mercilessly
      exposed and examined through a magnifying-glass, so that the lower classes
      might acquire that true humility failing which the upper classes cannot
      enjoy their amiable weaknesses in peace. And for the first time something
      jarring had come into this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      However much Theodore was tossed about between his natural yearning for
      the only half-realised temptations of the world, and his newly formed
      desire to turn his back on this world and his mind heavenwards, he did not
      break the promise given to his mother. The religious teaching which he and
      the other catechumens received from the minister in the church, did not
      fail to impress him deeply. He was often gloomy and wrapped in thought and
      felt that life was not what it ought to be. He had a dim notion that once
      upon a time a terrible crime had been committed, which it was now
      everybody&rsquo;s business to hide by practising countless deceptions; he
      compared himself to a fly caught in a spider&rsquo;s web: the more it struggled
      to regain its freedom, the more it entangled itself, until at last it died
      miserably, strangled by the cruel threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;the minister scorned no trick likely to produce an
      effect on his hard-headed pupils&mdash;they were having a lesson in the
      choir. It was in January. Two gas jets lighted up the choir, illuminating
      and distorting the marble figures on the altar. The whole of the large
      church with its two barrel-vaults, which crossed one another, lay in
      semi-darkness. In the background the shining organ pipes faintly reflected
      the gas flames; above it the angels blowing their trumpets to summon the
      sleepers before the judgment seat of their maker, looked merely like
      sinister, threatening human figures above life size; the cloisters were
      lost in complete darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister had explained the seventh commandment. He had spoken of
      immorality between married and unmarried people. He could not explain to
      his pupils what immorality between husband and wife meant, although he was
      a married man himself; but on the subject of immorality in all its other
      aspects he was well-informed. He went on to the subject of self-abuse. As
      he pronounced the word a rustling sound passed through the rows of young
      men; they stared at him, with white cheeks and hollow eyes, as if a
      phantom had appeared in their midst. As long as he kept to the tortures of
      hell fire, they remained fairly indifferent, but when he took up a book
      and read to them accounts of youths who had died at the age of twenty-five
      of consumption of the spine, they collapsed in their seats, and felt as if
      the floor were giving way beneath them! He told them the story of a young
      boy who was committed to an asylum at the age of twelve, and died at the
      age of fourteen, having found peace in the faith of his Redeemer. They saw
      before their shrinking eyes a hundred corpses, washed and shrouded. &ldquo;There
      is but one remedy against this evil,&rdquo; went on the minister, &ldquo;the precious
      wounds of Christ.&rdquo; But how this remedy was to be used against sexual
      precocity, he did not tell them. He admonished them not to go to dances,
      to shun theatres and gaming-houses, and above all things, to avoid women;
      that is to say to act in exact contradiction to their inclinations. That
      this vice contradicts and utterly confounds he pronouncement of the
      community that a man is not mature until he is twenty-one, was passed over
      in silence. Whether it could be prevented by early marriages (supposing a
      means of providing food for all instead of banquets for a few could be
      found) remained an open question. The final issue was that one should
      throw oneself into the arms of Christ, that is to say, go to church, and
      leave the care of temporal things to the upper classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this admonishment the minister requested the first five on the first
      form to stay behind. He wished to speak to them in private. The first five
      looked as if they had been sentenced to death. Their chests contracted;
      they breathed with difficulty, and a careful observer might have noticed
      that their hair had risen an inch at the roots and lay over their skulls
      in damp strands like the hair of a corpse. Their eyes stared from their
      blanched sockets like two round glass bullets set in leather, motionless,
      not knowing whether to face the question with a bold front, or hide behind
      an impudent lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the prayer the hymn of Christ&rsquo;s wounds was sung; to-night it sounded
      like the singing of consumptives; every now and then it died away
      altogether, or was interrupted by a dry cough, like the cough of a man who
      is dying of thirst. Then they began to file out. One of the five attempted
      to steal away, but the minister called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible moment. Theodore who sat on the first form was one of
      the five. He felt sick at heart. Not because he was guilty of the offence
      indicated, but because in his heart he considered it an insult to a man
      thus to have to lay bare the most secret places of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other four sat down, as far from each other as they could. The
      belt-maker&rsquo;s apprentice, who was one of them, tried to make a joke, but
      the words refused to come. They saw themselves confronted by the
      police-court, the prison, the hospital and, in the background, the asylum.
      They did not know what was going to happen, but they felt instinctively
      that a species of scourging awaited them. Their only comfort in their
      distressing situation was the fact that <i>he</i>, Mr. Theodore, was one
      of them. It was not clear to them why that fact should be a comfort, but
      they knew intuitively that no evil would happen to the son of a professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Wennerstroem,&rdquo; said the minister, after he had lighted the
      gas in the vestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wennerstroem went and the door closed behind him. The four remained seated
      on their forms, vainly trying to discover a comfortable position for their
      limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while Wennerstroem returned, with red eyes, trembling with
      excitement; he immediately went down the corridor and out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he stood in the churchyard which lay silent under a heavy cover of
      snow, he recapitulated all that had happened in the vestry. The minister
      had asked him whether he had sinned? No, he had not. Did he have dreams?
      Yes! He was told that dreams were equally sinful, because they proved that
      the heart was wicked, and God looked at the heart. &ldquo;He trieth the heart
      and reins, and on the last day he will judge every one of us for every
      sinful thought, and dreams are thoughts. Christ has said: Give me your
      heart, my son! Go to Him! Pray, pray, pray! Whatsoever is chaste,
      whatsoever is pure, whatsoever is lovely&mdash;that is He. The alpha and
      the omega, life and happiness. Chasten the flesh and be strong in prayer.
      Go in the name of the Lord and sin no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt indignant, but he was also crushed. In vain did he struggle to
      throw off his depression, he had not been taught sufficient common-sense
      at school to use it as a weapon against this Jesuitical sophistry. It was
      true, his knowledge of psychology enabled him to modify the statement that
      dreams are thoughts; dreams are fancies, he mused, creations of the
      imagination; but God has no regard for words! Logic taught him that there
      was something unnatural in his premature desires. He could not marry at
      the age of sixteen, since he was unable to support a wife; but why he was
      unable to support a wife, although he felt himself to be a man, was a
      problem which he could not solve. However anxious he might be to get
      married, the laws of society which are made by the upper classes and
      protected by bayonets, would prevent him. Consequently nature must have
      been sinned against in some way, for a man was mature long before he was
      able to earn a living. It must be degeneracy. His imagination must be
      degenerate; it was for him to purify it by prayer and sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived home, he found his father and sisters at supper. He was
      ashamed to sit down with them, for he felt degraded. His father asked him,
      as usual, whether the date of the confirmation had been fixed. Theodore
      did not know. He touched no food, pretending that he was not well; the
      truth was that he did not dare to eat any supper. He went into his bedroom
      and read an essay by Schartau which the minister had lent him. The subject
      was the vanity of reason. And here, just here, where all his hopes of
      arriving at a clear understanding were centred, the light failed. Reason
      which he had dared to hope would some day guide him out of the darkness
      into the light, reason, too, was sin; the greatest of all sins, for it
      questioned God&rsquo;s very existence, tried to understand what was not meant to
      be understood. Why <i>it</i> was not meant to be understood, was not
      explained; probably it was because if <i>it</i> had been understood the
      fraud would have been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rebelled no longer, but surrendered himself. Before going to bed he
      read two <i>Morning Voices</i> from Arndt, recited the Creed, the Lord&rsquo;s
      Prayer and the Blessing. He felt very hungry; a fact which he realised
      with a certain spiteful pleasure, for it seemed to him that his enemy was
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts he fell asleep. He awoke in the middle of the night.
      He had dreamt of a champagne supper in the company of a girl. And the
      whole terrible evening arose fresh in his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leapt out of bed with a bound, threw his sheets and blankets on the
      floor and lay down to sleep on the bare mattress, covering himself with
      nothing but a thin coverlet. He was cold and hungry, but he must subdue
      the devil. Again he repeated the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, with additions of his own.
      By and by his thoughts grew confused, the strained expression of his
      features relaxed, a smile softened the expression of his mouth; lovely
      figures appeared before him, serene and smiling, he heard subdued voices,
      half-stifled laughter, a few bars from a waltz, saw sparkling glasses and
      frank and merry faces with candid eyes, which met his own unabashed;
      suddenly a curtain was parted in the middle; a charming little face peeped
      through the red silk draperies, with smiling lips and dancing eyes; the
      slender throat is bare, the beautiful sloping shoulders look as if they
      had been modelled by a caressing hand; she holds out her arms and he draws
      her to his thumping heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock was striking three. Again he had been worsted in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determined to win, he picked up the mattress and threw it out of the bed.
      Then he knelt on the cold floor and fervently prayed to God for strength,
      for he felt that he was indeed wrestling with the devil. When he had
      finished his prayer he lay down on the bare frame, and with a feeling of
      satisfaction felt the ropes and belting cutting into his arms and shins.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke in the morning in a high fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was laid up for six weeks. When he arose from his bed of sickness, he
      felt better than he had ever felt before. The rest, the good food and the
      medicine had increased his strength, and the struggle was now twice as
      hard. But he continued to struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His confirmation took place in the spring. The moving scene in which the
      lower classes promise on oath never to interfere with these things which
      the upper classes consider their privilege, made a lasting impression on
      him. It didn&rsquo;t trouble him that the minister offered him wine bought from
      the wine-merchant Högstedt at sixty-five öre the pint, and wafers from
      Lettstroem, the baker, at one crown a pound, as the flesh and blood of the
      great agitator Jesus of Nazareth, who was done to death nineteen hundred
      years ago. He didn&rsquo;t think about it, for one didn&rsquo;t think in those days,
      one had emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after his confirmation he passed his final examination. The smart
      little college cap was a source of great pleasure to him; without being
      actually conscious of it, he felt that he, as a member of the upper
      classes, had received a charter. They were not a little proud of their
      knowledge, too, these young men, for the masters had pronounced them
      &ldquo;mature.&rdquo; The conceited youths! If at least they had mastered all the
      nonsense of which they boasted! If anybody had listened to their
      conversation at the banquet given in their honour, it would have been a
      revelation to him. They declared openly that they had not acquired five
      per cent. of the knowledge which ought to have been in their possession;
      they assured everybody who had ears to listen that it was a miracle that
      they had passed; the uninitiated would not have believed a word of it. And
      some of the young masters, now that the barrier between pupil and teacher
      was removed, and simulation was no longer necessary, swore solemnly, with
      half-intoxicated gestures, that there was not a single master in the whole
      school who would not have been plucked. A sober person could not help
      drawing the conclusion that the examination was like a line which could be
      drawn at will between upper and lower classes; and then he saw in the
      miracle nothing but a gigantic fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the masters who, sipping a glass of punch, maintained that
      only an idiot could imagine that a human brain could remember at the same
      time: the three thousand dates mentioned in history; the names of the five
      thousand towns situated in all parts of the world; the names of six
      hundred plants and seven hundred animals; the bones in the human body, the
      stones which form the crust of the earth, all theological disputes, one
      thousand French words, one thousand English, one thousand German, one
      thousand Latin, one thousand Greek, half a million rules and exceptions to
      the rules: five hundred mathematical, physical, geometrical, chemical
      formulas. He was willing to prove that in order to be capable of such a
      feat the brain would have to be as large as the cupola of the Observatory
      at Upsala. Humboldt, he went on to say, finally forgot his tables, and the
      professor of astronomy at Lund had been unable to divide two whole numbers
      of six figures each. The newly-fledged under-graduates imagined that they
      knew six languages, and yet they knew no more than five thousand words at
      most of the twenty thousand which composed their mother tongue. And hadn&rsquo;t
      he seen how they cheated? Oh! he knew all their tricks! He had seen the
      dates written on their finger nails; he had watched them consulting books
      under cover of their desks, he had heard them whispering to one another!
      But, he concluded, what is one to do? Unless one closes an eye to these
      things, the supply of students is bound to come to an end. During the
      summer Theodore remained at home, spending much of his time in the garden.
      He brooded over the problem of his future; what profession was he to
      choose? He had gained so much insight into the methods of the huge
      Jesuitical community which, under the name of the upper classes,
      constituted society, that he felt dissatisfied with the world and decided
      to enter the Church to save himself from despair. And yet the world
      beckoned to him. It lay before him, fair and bright, and his young,
      fermenting blood yearned for life. He spent himself in the struggle and
      his idleness added to his torments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore&rsquo;s increasing melancholy and waning health began to alarm his
      father. He had no doubt about the cause, but he could not bring himself to
      talk to his son on such a delicate subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday afternoon the Professor&rsquo;s brother who was an officer in the
      Pioneers, called. They were sitting in the garden, sipping their coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed the change in Theodore?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his time has come,&rdquo; answered the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it has come long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d talk to him, I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a bachelor, I should play the part of the uncle,&rdquo; said the
      Captain; &ldquo;as it is, I&rsquo;ll ask Gustav to do it. The boy must see something
      of life, or he&rsquo;ll go wrong. Hot stuff these Wennerstroems, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;I was a man at fifteen, but I had a
      school-friend who was never confirmed because he was a father at
      thirteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Gustav! Isn&rsquo;t he a fine fellow? I&rsquo;m hanged if he isn&rsquo;t as broad
      across the back as an old captain! He&rsquo;s a handful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Professor, &ldquo;he costs me a lot, but after all, I&rsquo;d
      rather pay than see the boy running any risks. I wish you&rsquo;d ask Gustav to
      take Theodore about with him a little, just to rouse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! with pleasure!&rdquo; answered the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the matter was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in July, when the summer is in its prime and all the blossoms
      which the spring has fertilised ripen into fruit, Theodore was sitting in
      his bed-room, waiting. He had pinned a text against his wall. &ldquo;Come to
      Jesus,&rdquo; it said, and it was intended as a hint to the lieutenant not to
      argue with him when he occasionally came home from barracks for a few
      minutes. Gustav was of a lively disposition, &ldquo;a handful,&rdquo; as his uncle had
      said. He wasted no time in brooding. He had promised to call for Theodore
      at seven o&rsquo;clock; they were going to make arrangements for the celebration
      of the professor&rsquo;s birthday. Theodore&rsquo;s secret plan was to convert his
      brother, and Gustav&rsquo;s equally secret intention was to make his younger
      brother take a more reasonable view of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctually at seven o&rsquo;clock, a cab stopped before the house, (the
      lieutenant invariably arrived in a cab) and immediately after Theodore
      heard the ringing of his spurs and the rattling of his sword on the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, you old mole,&rdquo; said the elder brother with a laugh. He was
      the picture of health and youth. His highly-polished Hessian boots
      revealed a pair of fine legs, his tunic outlined the loins of a
      cart-horse; the golden bandolier of his cartridge box made his chest
      appear broader and his sword-belt showed off a pair of enormous thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the text and grinned, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, old man, let&rsquo;s be off to Bellevue! We&rsquo;ll call on the gardener
      there and make arrangements for the old man&rsquo;s birthday. Put on your hat,
      and come, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore tried to think of an excuse, but the brother took him by the arm,
      put a hat on his head, back to front, pushed a cigarette between his lips
      and opened the door. Theodore felt like a fish out of water, but he went
      with his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bellevue!&rdquo; said the lieutenant to the cab-driver, &ldquo;and mind you make
      your thoroughbreds fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore could not help being amused. It would never have occurred to him
      to address an elderly married man, like the cabman, with so much
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way the lieutenant talked of everything under the sun and stared at
      every pretty girl they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met a funeral procession on its return from the cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice that devilish pretty girl in the last coach?&rdquo; asked
      Gustav.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore had not seen her and did not want to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed an omnibus full of girls of the barmaid type. The lieutenant
      stood up, unconcernedly, in the public thoroughfare, and kissed his hands
      to them. He really behaved like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business at Bellevue was soon settled. On their return the cab-driver
      drove them, without waiting for an order, to &ldquo;The Equerry,&rdquo; a restaurant
      where Gustav was evidently well-known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and have something to eat,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, pushing his
      brother out of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore was fascinated. He was no abstainer and saw nothing wrong in
      entering a public-house, although it never occurred to him to do so. He
      followed, though not without a slight feeling of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were received in the hall by two girls. &ldquo;Good evening, little doves,&rdquo;
       said the lieutenant, and kissed them both on the lips. &ldquo;Let me introduce
      you to my learned brother; he&rsquo;s very young and innocent, not at all like
      me; what do you say, Jossa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked shyly at Theodore, who did not know which way to turn.
      His brother&rsquo;s language appeared to him unutterably impudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way upstairs they met a dark-haired little girl, who had
      evidently been crying; she looked quiet and modest and made a good
      impression on Theodore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant did not kiss her, but he pulled out his handkerchief and
      dried her eyes. Then he ordered an extravagant supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in a bright and pretty room, hung with mirrors and containing a
      piano, a perfect room for banquetting. The lieutenant opened the piano
      with his sword, and before Theodore knew where he was, he was sitting on
      the music-stool, and his hands were resting on the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play us a waltz,&rdquo; commanded the lieutenant, and Theodore played a waltz.
      The lieutenant took off his sword and danced with Jossa; Theodore heard
      his spurs knocking against the legs of the chairs and tables. Then he
      threw himself on the sofa and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, ye slaves, and fan me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore began to play softly and presently he was absorbed in the music
      of Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. He did not dare to turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and kiss him,&rdquo; whispered the brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girls felt shy. They were almost afraid of him and his melancholy
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldest of them, however, went up to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are playing from the Freischütz, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Theodore, politely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother looks frightfully respectable,&rdquo; said the little dark one,
      whose name was Rieke; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s different to you, you old villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, he&rsquo;s going into the Church,&rdquo; whispered the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words made a great impression on the girls, and henceforth they only
      kissed the lieutenant when Theodore&rsquo;s back was turned, and looked at
      Theodore shyly and apprehensively, like fowls at a chained mastiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper appeared, a great number of courses. There were eighteen dishes,
      not counting the hot ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gustav poured out the liqueurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your health, you old hypocrite!&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore swallowed the liqueur. A delicious warmth ran through his limbs,
      a thin, warm veil fell over his eyes, he felt ravenous like a starving
      beast. What a banquet it was! The fresh salmon with its peculiar flavour,
      and the dill with its narcotic aroma; the radishes which seem to scrape
      the throat and call for beer; the small beef-steaks and sweet Portuguese
      onions, which made him think of dancing girls; the fried lobster which
      smelt of the sea; the chicken stuffed with parsley which reminded him of
      the gardener, and the first gerkins with their poisonous flavour of
      verdigris which made such a jolly, crackling sound between his crunching
      teeth. The porter flowed through his veins like hot streams of lava; they
      drank champagne after the strawberries; a waitress brought the foaming
      drink which bubbled in the glasses like a fountain. They poured out a
      glass for her. And then they talked of all sorts of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore sat there like a tree in which the sap is rising. He had eaten a
      good supper and felt as if a whole volcano was seething in his inside. New
      thoughts, new emotions, new ideas, new points of view fluttered round his
      brow like butterflies. He went to the piano and played, he himself knew
      not what. The ivory keys under his hands were like a heap of bones from
      which his spirit drew life and melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how long he had been playing, but when he turned, round he
      saw his brother entering the room. He looked like a god, radiating life
      and strength. Behind him came Rieke with a bowl of punch, and immediately
      after all the girls came upstairs. The lieutenant drank to each one of
      them separately; Theodore found that everything was as it should be and
      finally became so bold that he kissed Rieke on the shoulder. But she
      looked annoyed and drew away from him, and he felt ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Theodore found himself alone in his room, he had a feeling as if the
      whole world were turned upside down. He tore the text from the wall, not
      because he no longer believed in Jesus, but because its being pinned
      against the wall struck him as a species of bragging. He was amazed to
      find that religion sat on him as loosely as a Sunday suit, and he asked
      himself whether it was not unseemly to go about during the whole week in
      Sunday clothes. After all he was but an ordinary, commonplace person with
      whom he was well content, and he came to the conclusion that he had a
      better chance of living in peace with himself if he lived a simple,
      unpretentious, unassuming life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept soundly during the night, undisturbed by dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arose on the following morning, his pale cheeks looked fuller and
      there was a new gladness in his heart. He went out for a walk and suddenly
      found himself in the country. The thought struck him that he might go to
      the restaurant and look up the girls. He went into the large room; there
      he found Rieke and Jossa alone, in morning dresses, snubbing gooseberries.
      Before he knew what he was doing, he was sitting at the table beside them
      with a pair of scissors in his hand, helping them. They talked of
      Theodore&rsquo;s brother and the pleasant evening they had spent together. Not a
      single loose remark was made. They were just like a happy family; surely
      he had fallen in good hands, he was among friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished with the gooseberries, he ordered coffee and
      invited the girls to share it with him. Later on the proprietress came and
      read the paper to them. He felt at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated his visit. One afternoon he went upstairs, to look for Rieke.
      She was sewing a seam. Theodore asked her whether he was in her way. &ldquo;Not
      at all,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;on the contrary.&rdquo; They talked of his brother who
      was away at camp, and would be away for another two months. Presently he
      ordered some punch and their intimacy grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion Theodore met her in the Park. She was gathering
      flowers. They both sat down in the grass. She was wearing a light summer
      dress, the material of which was so thin that it plainly revealed her
      slight girlish figure. He put his arms round her waist and kissed her. She
      returned his kisses and he drew her to him in a passionate embrace; but
      she tore herself away and told him gravely that if he did not behave
      himself she would never meet him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on meeting one another for two months. Theodore had fallen in
      love with her. He had long and serious conversations with her on the most
      sacred duties of life, on love, on religion, on everything, and
      between-whiles he spoke to her of his passion. But she invariably
      confounded him with his own arguments. Then he felt ashamed of having
      harboured base thoughts of so innocent a girl, and finally his passion was
      transformed into admiration for this poor little thing, who had managed to
      keep herself unspotted in the midst of temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given up the idea of going into the Church; he determined to take
      the doctor&rsquo;s degree and&mdash;who knows&mdash;perhaps marry Rieke. He read
      poetry to her while she did needlework. She let him kiss her as much as he
      liked, she allowed him to fondle and caress her; but that was the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last his brother returned from camp. He immediately ordered a banquet
      at &ldquo;The Equerry&rdquo;; Theodore was invited. But he was made to play all the
      time. He was in the middle of a waltz, to which nobody danced, when he
      happened to look round; he was alone. He rose and went into the corridor,
      passed a long row of doors, and at last came to a bed-room. There he saw a
      sight which made him turn round, seize his hat and disappear into the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dawn when he reached his own bed-room, alone, annihilated, robbed
      of his faith in life, in love, and, of course, in women, for to him there
      was but one woman in the world, and that was Rieke from &ldquo;The Equerry.&rdquo; On
      the fifteenth of September he went to Upsala to study theology.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The years passed. His sound common-sense was slowly extinguished by all
      the nonsense with which he had to fill his brain daily and hourly. But at
      night he was powerless to resist. Nature burst her bonds and took by force
      what rebellious man denied her. He lost his health; all his skull bones
      were visible in his haggard face, his complexion was sallow and his skin
      looked damp and clammy; ugly pimples appeared between the scanty locks of
      his beard. His eyes were without lustre, his hands so emaciated that the
      joints seemed to poke through the skin. He looked like the illustration to
      an essay on human vice, and yet he lived a perfectly pure life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the professor of Christian Ethics, a married man with very strict
      ideas on morality, called on him and asked him pointblank whether he had
      anything on his conscience; if so, he advised him to make a clean breast
      of it. Theodore answered that he had nothing to confess, but that he was
      unhappy. Thereupon the professor exhorted him to watch and pray and be
      strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother had written him a long letter, begging him not to take a
      certain stupid matter too much to heart. He told him that it was absurd to
      take a girl seriously. His philosophy, and he had always found it
      answering admirably, was to pay debts incurred and go; to play while one
      was young, for the gravity of life made itself felt quite soon enough.
      Marriage was nothing but a civil institution for the protection of the
      children. There was plenty of time for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore replied at some length in a letter imbued with true Christian
      sentiment, which the lieutenant left unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing his first examination in the spring, Theodore was obliged to
      spend a summer at Sköfde, in order to undergo the cold water cure. In the
      autumn he returned to Upsala. His newly-regained strength was merely so
      much fresh fuel to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters grew worse and worse. His hair had grown so thin that the scalp
      was plainly visible. He walked with dragging footsteps and whenever his
      fellow students met him in the street, they cut him as if he were
      possessed of all the vices. He noticed it and shunned them in his turn. He
      only left his rooms in the evening. He did not dare to go to bed at night.
      The iron which he had taken to excess, had ruined his digestion, and in
      the following summer the doctors sent him to Karlsbad.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Upsala, in the autumn, a rumour got abroad, an ugly
      rumour, which hung over the town like a black cloud. It was as if a drain
      had been left open and men were suddenly reminded that the town, that
      splendid creation of civilisation, was built over a sea of corruption,
      which might at any moment burst its bonds and poison the inhabitants. It
      was said that Theodore Wennerstroem, in a paroxysm of passion had
      assaulted one of his friends, and the rumour did not lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father went to Upsala and had an interview with the Dean of the
      Theological Faculty. The professor of pathology was present. What was to
      be done? The doctor remained silent. They pressed him for his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you ask me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must give you an answer; but you know as
      well as I do that there is but one remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo; asked the theologian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need you ask?&rdquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the theologian, who was a married man. &ldquo;Surely, nature does
      not require immorality from a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father said that he quite understood the case, but that he was afraid
      of making recommendations to his son, on account of the risks the latter
      would run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t take care of himself he must be a fool,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean requested them to continue such an agitating conversation in a
      more suitable place.... He himself had nothing more to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ended the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Theodore was a member of the upper classes the scandal was hushed
      up. A few years later he passed his final, and was sent by the doctor to
      Spa. The amount of quinine which he had taken had affected his knees and
      he walked with two sticks. At Spa he looked so ill that he was a
      conspicuous figure even in a crowd of invalids.
    </p>
    <p>
      But an unmarried woman of thirty-five, a German, took compassion on the
      unhappy man. She spent many hours with him in a lonely summer arbour in
      the park, discussing the problems of life. She was a member of a big
      evangelical society, whose object was the raising of the moral standard.
      She showed him prospectuses for newspapers and magazines, the principal
      mission of which was the suppression of prostitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am thirty-five years old and enjoy excellent
      health! What fools&rsquo; talk it is to say that immorality is a necessary evil.
      I have watched and fought a good fight for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman silently compared her well-developed figure, her large
      hips, with his own wasted body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a difference there is between human beings in this world,&rdquo; was his
      unspoken comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn the Rev. Theodore Wennerstroem and Sophia Leidschütz,
      spinster, were engaged to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; sighed the father, when the news reached him in his house at
      Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it will end,&rdquo; thought the brother in his barracks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid that my poor Theodore is &lsquo;one of those Asra who die when they
      love.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Wennerstroem was married. Nine months after the wedding his wife
      presented him with a boy who suffered from rickets&mdash;another thirteen
      months and Theodore Wennerstroem had breathed his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor who filled up the certificate of death, looked at the fine
      healthy woman, who stood weeping by the small coffin which contained the
      skeleton of her young husband of not much over twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plus was too great, the minus too small,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and therefore
      the plus devoured the minus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the father, who received the news of his son&rsquo;s death on a Sunday, sat
      down to read a sermon. When he had finished, he fell into a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be something very wrong with a world where virtue is rewarded
      with death,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the virtuous widow, <i>née</i> Leidschütz, had two more husbands and
      eight children, wrote pamphlets on overpopulation and immorality. But her
      brother-in-law called her a cursed woman who killed her husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anything but virtuous lieutenant married and was father of six
      children. He got promotion and lived happily to the end of his life.

      The assistant had not thought of studying the price of wheat before he
      called on the major to ask him for the hand of his daughter; but the major
      had studied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love her,&rdquo; said the assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your salary?&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, twelve hundred crowns, at present; but we love one another....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has nothing to do with me; twelve hundred crowns is not enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I make a little in addition to my salary, and Louisa knows that

      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense! How much in addition to your salary?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;And then? How can I tell beforehand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, can&rsquo;t you tell beforehand? But you ought to know. You seem to
      imagine that being married simply means living together and amusing
      yourselves! No, my dear boy, there will be children, and children require
      feeding and clothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There needn&rsquo;t be babies directly, if one loves <i>as we love</i> one
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the dickens do you love one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>As we love</i> one another.&rdquo; He put his hand on his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t there be any children if people love as you love? You must be
      mad! But you are a decent, respectable member of society, and therefore
      I&rsquo;ll give my consent; but make good use of the time, my boy, and increase
      your income, for hard times are coming. The price of wheat is rising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant grew red in the face when he heard the last words, but his
      joy at the old man&rsquo;s consent was so great that he seized his hand and
      kissed it. Heaven knew how happy he was! When he walked for the first time
      down the street with his future bride on his arm, they both radiated
      light; it seemed to them that the passers-by stood still and lined the
      road in honour of their triumphal march; and they walked along with proud
      eyes, squared shoulders and elastic steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he called at her house; they sat down in the centre of the
      room and read proofs; she helped him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good sort,&rdquo; chuckled the old
      man. When they had finished, he took her in his arms and said: &ldquo;Now we
      have earned three crowns,&rdquo; and then he kissed her. On the following
      evening they went to the theatre and he took her home in a cab, and that
      cost twelve crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when he ought to have given a lesson in the evening, he (is
      there anything a man will not do for love&rsquo;s sake?) cancelled his lesson
      and took her out for a walk instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the wedding-day approached. They were very busy. They had to choose
      the furniture. They began with the most important purchases. Louisa had
      not intended to be present when he bought the bedroom furniture, but when
      it came to the point she went with him. They bought two beds, which were,
      of course, to stand side by side. The furniture had to be walnut, every
      single piece real walnut. And they must have spring mattresses covered
      with red and white striped tick, and bolsters filled with down; and two
      eiderdown quilts, exactly alike. Louisa chose blue, because she was very
      fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the best stores. They could not do without a red hanging-lamp
      and a Venus made of plaster of Paris. Then they bought a dinner-service;
      and six dozen differently shaped glasses with cut edges; and knives and
      forks, grooved and engraved with their initials. And then the kitchen
      utensils! Mama had to accompany them to see to those.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a lot he had to do besides! There were bills to accept, journeys
      to the banks and interviews with tradespeople and artisans; a flat had to
      be found and curtains had to be put up. He saw to everything. Of course he
      had to neglect his work; but once he was married, he would soon make up
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were only going to take two rooms to begin with, for they were going
      to be frightfully economical. And as they were only going to have two
      rooms, they could afford to furnish them well. He rented two rooms and a
      kitchen on the first floor in Government Street, for six hundred crowns.
      When Louisa remarked that they might just as well have taken three rooms
      and a kitchen on the fourth floor for five hundred crowns, he was a little
      embarrassed; but what did it matter if only they loved one another? Yes,
      of course, Louisa agreed, but couldn&rsquo;t they have loved one another just as
      well in four rooms at a lower rent, as in three at a higher? Yes, he
      admitted that he had been foolish, but what <i>did</i> it matter so long
      as they loved one another?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were furnished. The bed-room looked like a little temple. The
      two beds stood side by side, like two carriages. The rays of the sun fell
      on the blue eiderdown quilt, the white, white sheets and the little
      pillow-slips which an elderly maiden aunt had embroidered with their
      monogram; the latter consisted of two huge letters, formed of flowers,
      joined together in one single embrace, and kissing here and there,
      wherever they touched, at the corners. The bride had her own little
      alcove, which was screened off by a Japanese screen. The drawing-room,
      which was also dining-room, study and morning-room, contained her piano,
      (which had cost twelve hundred crowns) his writing-table with twelve
      pigeon-holes, (every single piece of it real walnut) a pier-glass,
      armchairs; a sideboard and a dining-table. &ldquo;It looks as if nice people
      lived here,&rdquo; they said, and they could not understand why people wanted a
      separate dining-room, which always looked so cheerless with its cane
      chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place on a Saturday. Sunday dawned, the first day of
      their married life. Oh! what a life it was! Wasn&rsquo;t it lovely to be
      married! Wasn&rsquo;t marriage a splendid institution! One was allowed one&rsquo;s own
      way in everything, and parents and relations came and congratulated one
      into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning their bedroom was still dark. He wouldn&rsquo;t
      open the shutters to let in daylight, but re-lighted the red lamp which
      threw its bewitching light on the blue eiderdown, the white sheets, a
      little crumpled now, and the Venus made of plaster of Paris, who stood
      there rosy-red and without shame. And the red light also fell on his
      little wife who nestled in her pillows with a look of contrition, and yet
      so refreshed as if she had never slept so well in all her life. There was
      no traffic in the street to-day for it was Sunday, and the church-bells
      were calling people to the morning service with exulting, eager voices, as
      if they wanted all the world to come to church and praise Him who had
      created men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered to his little bride to shut her eyes so that he might get up
      and order breakfast. She buried her head in the pillows, while he slipped
      on his dressing-gown and went behind the screen to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A broad radiant path of sunlight lay on the sitting-room floor; he did not
      know whether it was spring or summer, autumn or winter; he only knew that
      it was Sunday!
    </p>
    <p>
      His bachelor life was receding into the background like something ugly and
      dark; the sight of his little home stirred his heart with a faint
      recollection of the home of his childhood, and at the same time held out a
      glorious promise for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strong he felt! The future appeared to him like a mountain coming to
      meet him. He would breathe on it and the mountain would fall down at his
      feet like sand; he would fly away, far above gables and chimneys, holding
      his little wife in his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He collected his clothes which were scattered all over the room; he found
      his white neck-tie hanging on a picture frame; it looked like a big white
      butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the kitchen. How the new copper vessels sparkled, the new tin
      kettles shone! And all this belonged to him and to her! He called the maid
      who came out of her room in her petticoat. But he did not notice it, nor
      did he notice that her shoulders were bare. For him there was but one
      woman in all the world. He spoke to the girl as a father would to his
      daughter. He told her to go to the restaurant and order breakfast, at
      once, a first-rate breakfast. Porter and Burgundy! The manager knew his
      taste. She was to give him his regards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out of the kitchen and knocked at the bed-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little startled scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, darling, wait a bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the breakfast table himself. When the breakfast was brought from
      the restaurant, he served it on her new breakfast set. He folded the
      dinner napkins according to all the rules of art. He wiped the
      wine-glasses, and finally took her bridal-bouquet and put it in a vase
      before her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she emerged from her bed-room in her embroidered morning gown and
      stepped into the brilliant sunlight, she felt just a tiny bit faint; he
      helped her into the armchair, made her drink a little liqueur out of a
      liqueur glass and eat a caviare sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      What fun it all was! One could please oneself when one was married. What
      would Mama have said if she had seen her daughter drinking liqueurs at
      this hour of the morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited on her as if she were still his fiancee. What a breakfast they
      were having on the first morning after their wedding! And nobody had a
      right to say a word. Everything was perfectly right and proper, one could
      enjoy oneself with the very best of consciences, and that was the most
      delightful part of it all. It was not for the first time that he was
      eating such a breakfast, but what a difference between then and now! He
      had been restless and dissatisfied then; he could not bear to think of it,
      now. And as he drank a glass of genuine Swedish porter after the oysters,
      he felt the deepest contempt for all bachelors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of people not to get married! Such selfishness! They ought to
      be taxed like dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for those poor men who haven&rsquo;t the means to get married,&rdquo;
       replied his demure little wife kindly, &ldquo;for I am sure, if they had the
      means they would all get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little pang shot through the assistant&rsquo;s heart; for a moment he felt
      afraid, lest he had been a little too venturesome. All his happiness
      rested on the solution of a financial problem, and if, if.... Pooh! A
      glass of Burgundy! Now he would work! They should see!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game? With cranberries and cucumbers!&rdquo; The young wife was a little
      startled, but it was really delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lewis, darling,&rdquo; she put a trembling little hand on his arm, &ldquo;can we
      afford it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately she said &ldquo;we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! It doesn&rsquo;t matter for once! Later on we can dine on potatoes and
      herrings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you eat potatoes and herrings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have been drinking more than is good for you, and expect a
      beefsteak after the herring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Nothing of the kind! Your health, sweetheart! The game is
      excellent! So are these artichokes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you are mad, darling! Artichokes at this time of the year! What a
      bill you will have to pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill! Aren&rsquo;t they good? Don&rsquo;t you think that it is glorious to be alive?
      Oh! It&rsquo;s splendid, splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon a carriage drove up to the front door. The
      young wife would have been angry if it had not been so pleasant to loll
      luxuriously on the soft cushions, while they were being slowly driven to
      the Deer Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like lying on a couch,&rdquo; whispered Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      She playfully hit his fingers with her sunshade. Mutual acquaintances
      bowed to them from the footpath. Friends waved their hands to him as if
      they were saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! you rascal, you have come into a fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How small the passers-by looked, how smooth the street was, how pleasant
      their ride on springs and cushions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Life should always be like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It went on for a whole month. Balls, visits, dinners, theatres. Sometimes,
      of course, they remained at home. And at home it was more pleasant than
      anywhere else. How lovely, for instance, to carry off one&rsquo;s wife from her
      parents&rsquo; house, after supper, without saying as much as &ldquo;by your leave,&rdquo;
       put her into a closed carriage, slam the door, nod to her people and say:
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re off home, to our own four walls! And there we&rsquo;ll do exactly
      what we like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then to have a little supper at home and sit over it, talking and
      gossiping until the small hours of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was always very sensible at home, at least in theory. One day his
      wife put him to the test by giving him salt salmon, potatoes boiled in
      milk and oatmeal soup for dinner. Oh! how he enjoyed it! He was sick of
      elaborate menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Friday, when she again suggested salt salmon for dinner,
      Lewis came home, carrying two ptarmigans! He called to her from the
      threshold:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just imagine, Lou, a most extraordinary thing happened! A most
      extraordinary thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hardly believe me when I tell you that I bought a brace of
      ptarmigans, bought them myself at the market for&mdash;guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His little wife seemed more annoyed than curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think! One crown the two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have bought ptarmigans at eightpence the brace; but&mdash;&rdquo; she added
      in a more conciliatory tone, so as not to upset him altogether, &ldquo;that was
      in a very cold winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you must admit that I bought them very cheaply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there anything she would not admit in order to see him happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had ordered boiled groats for dinner, as an experiment. But after
      Lewis had eaten a ptarmigan, he regretted that he could not eat as much of
      the groats as he would have liked, in order to show her that he was really
      very fond of groats. He liked groats very much indeed&mdash;milk did not
      agree with him after his attack of ague. He couldn&rsquo;t take milk, but groats
      he would like to see on his table every evening, every blessed evening of
      his life, if only she wouldn&rsquo;t be angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And groats never again appeared on his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had been married for six weeks, the young wife fell ill. She
      suffered from headaches and sickness. It could not be anything serious,
      just a little cold. But this sickness? Had she eaten anything which had
      disagreed with her? Hadn&rsquo;t all the copper vessels new coatings of tin? He
      sent for the doctor. The doctor smiled and said it was all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was all right? Oh! Nonsense! It wasn&rsquo;t possible. How could it have
      been possible? No, surely, the bed-room paper was to blame. It must
      contain arsenic. Let us send a piece to the chemist&rsquo;s at once and have it
      tested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely free from arsenic,&rdquo; reported the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange! No arsenic in the wall papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife was still ill. He consulted a medical book and whispered a
      question in her ear. &ldquo;There now! a hot bath!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four weeks later the midwife declared that everything was &ldquo;as it should
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it should be? Well, of course! Only it was somewhat premature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as it could not, be helped, they were delighted. Fancy, a baby! They
      would be papa and mama! What should they call him? For, of course, it
      would be a boy. No doubt, it would. But now she had a serious conversation
      with her husband! There had been no translating or proof-correcting since
      their marriage. And his salary alone was not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they had given no thought to the morrow. But, dear me, one was young
      only once! Now, however, there would be a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning the assistant called on an old schoolfriend, a
      registrar, to ask him to stand security for a loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear fellow, when one is about to become a father, one has to
      consider how to meet increasing expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, old man,&rdquo; answered the registrar, &ldquo;therefore I have been unable
      to get married. But you are fortunate in having the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant hesitated to make his request. How could he have the
      audacity to ask this poor bachelor to help him to provide the expenses for
      the coming event? This bachelor, who had not the means to found a family
      of his own? He could not bring himself to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home to dinner, his wife told him that two gentlemen had
      called to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they look like? Were they young? Did they wear eye-glasses? Then
      there was no doubt, they were two lieutenants, old friends of his whom he
      had met at Vaxholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they couldn&rsquo;t have been lieutenants; they were too old for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he knew; they were old college friends from Upsala, probably P. who
      was a lecturer, and O. who was a curate, now. They had come to see how
      their old pal was shaping as a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t come from Upsala, they came from Stockholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid was called in and cross-examined. She thought the callers had
      been shabbily dressed and had carried sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sticks! I can&rsquo;t make out what sort of people they can have been. Well,
      we&rsquo;ll know soon enough, as they said they would call again. But to change
      the subject, I happened to see a basket of hothouse strawberries at a
      really ridiculous price; it really is absurd! Just imagine, hothouse
      strawberries at one and sixpence a basket! And at this time of the year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my darling, what is this extravagance to lead to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right. I have got an order for a translation this very day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are in debt, Lewis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trifles! Mere nothings! It&rsquo;ll be all right when I take up a big loan,
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A loan! But that&rsquo;ll be a new debt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! But there&rsquo;ll be easy terms! Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk business now! Aren&rsquo;t
      these strawberries delicious? What? A glass of sherry with them would be
      tip-top. Don&rsquo;t you think so? Lina, run round to the stores and fetch a
      bottle of sherry, the best they have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After his afternoon nap, his wife insisted on a serious conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be angry, dear, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry? I! Good heavens, no! Is it about household expenses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! We owe money at the stores! The butcher is pressing for payment; the
      man from the livery stables has called for his money; it&rsquo;s most
      unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? I shall pay them to the last farthing to-morrow. How dare
      they worry you about such trifles? They shall be paid to-morrow, but they
      shall lose a customer. Now, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it any more. Come out
      for a walk. No carriage! Well, we&rsquo;ll take the car to the Deer Park, it
      will cheer us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went to the Deer Park. They asked for a private room at the
      restaurant, and people stared at them and whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think we are out on a spree,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;What fun! What madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his wife did not like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a big bill to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we had stayed at home! We might have bought such a lot of things
      for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Months elapsed. The great event was coming nearer and nearer. A cradle had
      to be bought and baby-clothes. A number of things were wanted. The young
      husband was out on business all day long. The price of wheat had risen.
      Hard times were at hand. He could get no translations, no
      proof-correcting. Men had become materialists. They didn&rsquo;t spend money on
      books, they bought food. What a prosaic period we were living in! Ideals
      were melting away, one after the other, and ptarmigans were not to be had
      under two crowns the brace. The livery stables would not provide carriages
      for nothing for the cab-proprietors had wives and families to support,
      just as everybody else; at the stores cash had to be paid for goods, Oh!
      what realists they all were!
    </p>
    <p>
      The great day had come at last. It was evening. He must run for the
      midwife. And while his wife suffered all the pangs of childbirth, he had
      to go down into the hall and pacify the creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he held a daughter in his arms. His tears fell on the baby, for
      now he realised his responsibility, a responsibility which he was unable
      to shoulder. He made new resolutions. But his nerves were unstrung. He was
      working at a translation which he seemed unable to finish, for he had to
      be constantly out on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed to his father-in-law, who was staying in town, to bring him the
      glad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a little daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and good,&rdquo; replied his father-in-law; &ldquo;can you support a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present; for heaven&rsquo;s sake, help us, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tide you over your present difficulties. I can&rsquo;t do more. My means
      are only sufficient to support my own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient required chickens which he bought himself at the market, and
      wine at six crowns the bottle. It had to be the very best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midwife expected a hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we pay her less than others? Hasn&rsquo;t she just received a cheque
      for a hundred crowns from the captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very soon the young wife was up again. She looked like a girl, as slender
      as a willow, a little pale, it was true, but the pallor suited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man called and had a private conversation with his son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more children, for the present,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll be ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What language from a father! Aren&rsquo;t we married! Don&rsquo;t we love one
      another? Aren&rsquo;t we to have a family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not until you can provide for them. It&rsquo;s all very fine to love
      one another, but you musn&rsquo;t forget that you have responsibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father-in-law, too, had become a materialist. Oh! what a miserable
      world it was! A world without ideals!
    </p>
    <p>
      The home was undermined, but love survived, for love was strong, and the
      hearts of the young couple were soft. The bailiff, on the contrary, was
      anything but soft. Distraint was imminent, and bankruptcy threatened.
      Well, let them distrain then!
    </p>
    <p>
      The father-in-law arrived with a large travelling coach to fetch his
      daughter and grand-child. He warned his son-in-law not to show his face at
      his house until he could pay his debts and make a home for his wife and
      child. He said nothing to his daughter, but it seemed to him that he was
      bringing home a girl who had been led astray. It was as if he had lent his
      innocent child to a casual admirer and now received her back
      &ldquo;dishonoured.&rdquo; She would have preferred to stay with her husband, but he
      had no home to offer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the husband of one year&rsquo;s standing was left behind to watch the
      pillaging of his home, if he could call it his home, for he had paid for
      nothing. The two men with spectacles carted away the beds and bedclothes;
      the copper kettles and tin vessels; the dinner set, the chandelier and the
      candlesticks; everything, everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was left alone in the two empty, wretched rooms! If only <i>she</i> had
      been left to him! But what should she do here, in these empty rooms? No,
      she was better off where she was! She was being taken care of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the struggle for a livelihood began in bitter earnest. He found work
      at a daily paper as a proof-corrector. He had to be at the office at
      midnight; at three in the morning his work was done. He did not lose his
      berth, for bankruptcy had been avoided, but he had lost all chance of
      promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he is permitted to visit wife and child once a week, but he is
      never allowed to see her alone. He spends Saturday night in a tiny room,
      close to his father-in-law&rsquo;s bedroom. On Sunday morning he has to return
      to town, for the paper appears on Monday morning.... He says good-bye to
      his wife and child who are allowed to accompany him as far as the garden
      gate, he waves his hand to them once more from the furthest hillock, and
      succumbs to his wretchedness, his misery, his humiliation. And she is no
      less unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has calculated that it will take him twenty years to pay his debts. And
      then? Even then he cannot maintain a wife and child. And his prospects? He
      has none! If his father-in-law should die, his wife and child would be
      thrown on the street; he cannot venture to look forward to the death of
      their only support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! How cruel it is of nature to provide food for all her creatures,
      leaving the children of men alone to starve! Oh! How cruel, how cruel!
      that life has not ptarmigans and strawberries to give to all men. How
      cruel! How cruel!

    <h2>
      COMPELLED TO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Punctually at half past nine on a winter evening he appears at the door
      leading to the glass-roofed verandah of the restaurant. While, with
      mathematical precision, he takes off his gloves, he peers over his dim
      spectacles, first to the right, then to the left, to find out whether any
      of his acquaintances are present. Then he hangs up his overcoat on its
      special hook, the one to the right of the fireplace. Gustav, the waiter,
      an old pupil of his, flies to his table and, without waiting for an order,
      brushes the crumbs off the tablecloth, stirs up the mustard, smooths the
      salt in the salt-cellar and turns over the dinner napkin. Then he fetches,
      still without any order, a bottle of Medhamra, opens half a bottle of
      Union beer and, merely for appearance sake, hands the schoolmaster the
      bill of fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crabs?&rdquo; he asks, more as a matter of form than because there is any need
      of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Female crabs,&rdquo; answers the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large, female crabs,&rdquo; repeats Gustav, walks to the speaking tube which
      communicates with the kitchen, and shouts: &ldquo;Large female crabs for Mr.
      Blom, and plenty of dill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fetches butter and cheese, cuts two very thin slices of rye-bread, and
      places them on the schoolmaster&rsquo;s table. The latter has in the meantime
      searched the verandah for the evening papers, but has only found the
      official <i>Post</i>. To make up for this very poor success, he takes the
      <i>Daily Journal</i>, which he had not had time to finish at lunch, and
      after first opening and refolding the <i>Post</i>, and putting it on the
      top of the bread basket on his left, sits down to read it. He ornaments
      the rye-bread with geometrical butter hieroglyphics, cuts off a piece of
      cheese in the shape of a rectangle, fills his liqueur glass three quarters
      full and raises it to his lips, hesitates as if the little glass contained
      physic, throws back his head and says: Ugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      He has done this for twelve years and will continue doing it until the day
      of his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the crabs, six of them, have been put before him, he examines
      them as to their sex, and everything being as it should be, makes ready to
      enjoy himself. He tucks a corner of his dinner napkin into his collar,
      places two slices of thin bread and cheese by the side of his plate and
      pours out a glass of beer and half a glass of liqueur. Then he takes the
      little crab-knife and business begins. He is the only man in Sweden who
      knows how to eat a crab, and whenever he sees anybody else engaged in the
      same pursuit, he tells him that he has no idea how to do it. He makes an
      incision all round the head, and a hole against which he presses his lips
      and begins to suck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the best part of the whole animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He severs the thorax from the lower part, puts his teeth to the body and
      drinks deep draughts; he sucks the little legs as if they were asparagus,
      eats a bit of dill, and takes a drink of beer and a mouthful of rye-bread.
      When he has carefully taken the shell off the claws and sucked even the
      tiniest tubes, he eats the flesh; last of all he attacks the lower part of
      the body. When he has eaten three crabs, he drinks half a glass of liqueur
      and reads the promotions in the <i>Post</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has done this for twelve years and will continue doing it until he
      dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just twenty years old when he first began to patronise the
      restaurant, now he is thirty-two, and Gustav has been a waiter for ten
      years in the same place. Not one of its frequenters has known the
      restaurant longer than the school-master, not even the proprietor who took
      it over eight years ago. He has watched generations of diners come and go;
      some came for a year, some for two, some for five years; then they
      disappeared, went to another restaurant, left the town or got married. He
      feels very old, although he is only thirty-two! The restaurant is his
      home, for his furnished room is nothing but the place where he sleeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ten o&rsquo;clock. He leaves his table and goes to the back room where his
      grog awaits him. This is the time when the bookseller arrives. They play a
      game of chess or talk about books. At half-past ten the second violin from
      the Dramatic Theatre drops in. He is an old Pole who, after 1864, escaped
      to Sweden, and now makes a living by his former hobby. Both the Pole and
      the bookseller are over fifty, but they get on with the schoolmaster as if
      he were a contemporary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor has his place behind the counter. He is an old sea captain
      who fell in love with the proprietress and married her. She rules in the
      kitchen, but the sliding panel is always open, so that she can keep an eye
      on the old man, lest he should take a glass too much before closing time.
      Not until the gas has been turned out, and the old man is ready to go to
      bed, is he allowed a nightcap in the shape of a stiff glass of rum and
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock the young bloods begin to arrive; they approach the
      counter diffidently and ask the proprietor in a whisper whether any of the
      private rooms upstairs are disengaged, and then there is a rustling of
      skirts in the hall and cautious footsteps are creeping upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the bookseller, who has suddenly found a topic of
      conversation, &ldquo;when are you going to be married, Blom, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the means to get married,&rdquo; answered the school-master. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you take a wife to your bosom yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman would have me, now that my head looks like an old,
      leather-covered trunk,&rdquo; says the bookseller. &ldquo;And, moreover, there&rsquo;s my
      old Stafva, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stafva was a legendary person in whom nobody believed. She was the
      incarnation of the bookseller&rsquo;s unrealised dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, Mr. Potocki?&rdquo; suggested the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been married once, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; replies the bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pole nods his head like a metrometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was married very happily. Ugh!&rdquo; he says and finishes his grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continues the schoolmaster, &ldquo;if women weren&rsquo;t such fools, one
      might consider the matter; but they are infernal fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole nods again and smiles; being a Pole, he doesn&rsquo;t understand what
      the word fool means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been married very happily, ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there is the noise of the children, and children&rsquo;s clothes
      always drying near the stove; and servants, and all day long the smells
      from the kitchen. No, thank you! And, perhaps, sleepless nights into the
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; added the Pole, completing the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Potocki says &lsquo;ugh&rsquo; with the malice of the bachelor who listens to the
      complaints of the married man,&rdquo; remarked the bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; asks the astonished widower. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; says the bookseller,
      mimicking him, and the conversation degenerates into a universal grinning
      and a cloud of tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is midnight. The piano upstairs, which has accompanied a mixed choir of
      male and female voices, is silent. The waiter has finished his countless
      journeys from the speaking tube to the verandah; the proprietor enters
      into his daybook the last few bottles of champagne which have been ordered
      upstairs. The three friends rise from their chairs and go home, two to
      their &ldquo;virgin couches,&rdquo; and the bookseller to his Stafva.
    </p>
    <p>
      When schoolmaster Blom had reached his twentieth year, he was compelled to
      interrupt his studies at Upsala and accept a post as assistant teacher at
      Stockholm. As he, in addition, gave private lessons, he made quite a good
      income. He did not ask much of life. All he wanted was peace and
      cleanliness. An elderly lady let him a furnished room and there he found
      more than a bachelor finds as a rule. She looked after him and was kind to
      him; she gave him all the tenderness which nature had intended her to
      bestow on the new generation that was to spring from her. She mended his
      clothes and looked after him generally. He had lost his mother when he was
      a little boy and had never been accustomed to gratuitous kindness;
      therefore he was inclined to look upon her services as an interference
      with his liberty, but he accepted them nevertheless. But all the same the
      public house was his real home. There he paid for everything and ran up no
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in a small town in the interior of Sweden; consequently he was
      a stranger in Stockholm. He knew nobody; was not on visiting terms with
      any of the families and met his acquaintances nowhere but at the
      public-house. He talked to them freely, but never gave them his
      confidence, in fact he had no confidence to give. At school he taught the
      third class and this gave him a feeling of having been stunted in his
      growth. A very long time ago he had been in the third class himself, had
      gradually crept up to the seventh, and had spent a few terms at the
      University; now he had returned to the third; he had been there for twelve
      years without being moved. He taught the second and third books of Euclid;
      this was the course of instruction for the whole year. He saw only a
      fragment of life; a fragment without beginning or end; the second and
      third books. In his spare time he read the newspapers and books on
      archaeology. Archaeology is a modern science, one might almost say a
      disease of the time. And there is danger in it, for it proves over and
      over again that human folly has pretty nearly always been the same.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Politics was to him nothing but an interesting game of chess&mdash;played
for the king, for he was brought up like everybody else; it was an
article of faith with him that nothing which happened in the world,
concerned him, personally; let those look to it whom God had placed in
a position of power. This way of looking at things filled his soul
with peace and tranquillity; he troubled nobody and nothing troubled
him. When he found, as he did occasionally, that an unusually foolish
event had occurred, he consoled himself with the conviction that it
could not have been helped. His education had made him selfish, and
the catechism had taught him that if everybody did his duty, all
things would be well, whatever happened. He did his duty towards his
pupils in an exemplary fashion; he was never late; never ill. In his
private life, too, he was above reproach; he paid his rent on the day
it fell due, never ran up bills at his restaurant, and spent only one
evening a week on pleasure. His life glided along like a railway train
 to the second and, being a clever man, he managed to avoid collisions.
He gave no thought to the future; a truly selfish man never does, for
the simple reason that the future belongs to him for no longer than
twenty or thirty years at the most.
</pre>
    <p>
      And thus his days passed.

      Midsummer morning dawned&mdash;radiant and sunny as mid-summer morning
      should be. The schoolmaster was still in bed, reading a book on the Art of
      Warfare in ancient Egypt, when Miss Augusta came into his room with his
      breakfast. She had put on his tray some slices of saffron bread, in honour
      of the festival, and on his dinner-napkin lay a spray of elder blossoms.
      On the previous night she had decorated his room with branches of the
      birch-tree, put clean sand and some cowslips in the spittoon, and a bunch
      of lilies-of-the-valley on the dressing table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to make an excursion to-day, sir?&rdquo; she asked, glancing
      at the decorations, anxious for a word of thanks or approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Blom had not even noticed the decorations, and therefore he
      answered dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you realised yet that I never make excursions? I hate elbowing my
      way through a crowd, and the noise of the children gets on my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you won&rsquo;t stay in town on such a lovely day! You&rsquo;ll at least
      go to the Deer Park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be the very last place I should go to, especially to-day, when
      it will be crowded. Oh! no, I&rsquo;m better off in town, and I wish to goodness
      that this holiday nuisance would be stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty of people who say that there aren&rsquo;t half enough holidays
      these days when everybody has to work so hard,&rdquo; said the old woman in a
      conciliatory tone. &ldquo;But is there anything else you wish, sir? My sister
      and I are making an excursion by steamer, and we shan&rsquo;t be back until ten
      o&rsquo;clock to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy yourselves, Miss Augusta. I want nothing, and am
      quite able to look after myself. The caretaker can do my room when I have
      gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Augusta left him alone with his breakfast. When he had eaten it, he
      lit a cigar and remained in bed with his <i>Egyptian Warfare</i>. The open
      window shook softly in the southern breeze. At eight o&rsquo;clock the bells,
      large and small, of the nearest church began to ring, and those of the
      other churches of Stockholm, St. Catherine&rsquo;s, St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Jacob&rsquo;s,
      joined in; they tinkled and jingled, enough to make a heathen tear his
      hair in despair. When the church bells stopped, a military band on the
      bridge of a steamer began to play a set of quadrilles from <i>The Weak
      Point</i>. The schoolmaster writhed between his sheets, and would have got
      out of bed and shut the window if it had not been so hot. Next there came
      a rolling of drums, which was interrupted by the strains of a brass
      quintet which played, on another steamer, the Hunter&rsquo;s Chorus from the <i>Freischütz</i>.
      But the cursed rolling of drums approached. They were marching at the head
      of the Riflemen on their way to camp. Now he was subjected to a medley of
      sounds: the Riflemen&rsquo;s march, the signals, the bells and the brass bands
      on the steamers, until at last the whole crash and din was drowned by the
      throbbing of the screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock he lit his spirit lamp and boiled his shaving water. His
      starched shirt lay on his chest of drawers, white and stiff as a board. It
      took him a quarter of an hour to push the studs through the button-holes.
      He spent half-an-hour in shaving himself. He brushed his hair as if it
      were a matter of the utmost importance. When he put on his trousers, he
      was careful that the lower ends should not touch the floor and become
      dusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His room was simply furnished, extremely plain and tidy. It was
      impersonal, neutral, like the room in a hotel. And yet he had spent in it
      twelve years of his life. Most people collect no end of trifles during
      such a period; presents, little superfluous nothings, ornaments. Not a
      single engraving, not a supplement to an illustrated magazine even, which
      at some time or other had appealed to him, hung on the walls; no
      antimacassar, no rug worked by a loving sister, lay on the chairs; no
      photograph of a beloved face stood on his writing-table, no embroidered
      pen-wiper lay by the side of the ink-stand. Everything had been bought as
      cheaply as possible with a view to avoiding unnecessary expense which
      might have hampered the owner&rsquo;s independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned out of the window which gave him a view of the street and,
      across Artillery Place, of the harbour. In the house opposite a woman was
      dressing. He turned away as if something ugly had met his gaze, or
      something which might disturb his peace of mind. The harbour was gay with
      the fluttering flags on the steamers and sailing-ships, and the water
      glittered in the sunshine. A few old women, prayer-book in hand, passed
      his window on their way to church. A sentinel with drawn sword was walking
      up and down before the Artillery Barracks, glancing discontentedly at the
      clock on the tower every now and then to see how much longer he would have
      to wait until the relieving guard arrived. Otherwise the street lay empty
      and grey in the hot sunshine. His eyes wandered back to the woman
      opposite. She was standing before her looking-glass, powder puff in hand,
      intent on powdering the corners of her nose, with a grimace which made her
      look like a monkey. He left the window and sat down in his rocking chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his programme for the day, for he had a vague dread of solitude.
      On week days he was surrounded by the school-boys, and although he had no
      love for those wild beasts whose taming, or rather whose efficient
      acquisition of the difficult art of dissembling, was his life task, yet he
      felt a certain void when he was not with them. Now, during the long summer
      vacations, he had established a holiday school, but even so he had been
      compelled to give the boys short summer holidays, and, with the exception
      of meal times when he could always count on the bookseller and the second
      violin, he had been alone for several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;when the guard has been relieved, and the
      crowds have dispersed, I&rsquo;ll go to my restaurant to dine; then I&rsquo;ll invite
      the bookseller to Strömsborg; there won&rsquo;t be a soul to-day; we can have
      coffee there and punch, and stay till the evening when we&rsquo;ll return to
      town and to Rejner&rsquo;s.&rdquo; (Rejner&rsquo;s was the name of his restaurant in
      Berzelius Place.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctually at two o&rsquo;clock he took his hat, brushed himself carefully and
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether there&rsquo;ll be stewed perch to-day,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And
      mightn&rsquo;t one treat oneself to asparagus, as it&rsquo;s midsummer-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strolled past the high wall of the Government Bakery. In Berzelius Park
      the seats which were usually occupied by the nursemaids of the rich and
      their charges, were crowded with the families of the labourers who had
      appeared in great numbers with their perambulators. He saw a mother
      feeding her baby. She was a large, full-breasted woman, and the baby&rsquo;s
      dimpled hand almost disappeared in her bosom. The schoolmaster turned away
      with a feeling of loathing. He was annoyed to see these strangers in <i>his</i>
      park. It was very much like the servants using the drawing-room when their
      master and mistress had gone out; moreover, he couldn&rsquo;t forgive them their
      plainness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at the glass verandah, and put his hand on the door handle,
      thinking once more of the stewed perch &ldquo;with lots of parsley,&rdquo; when his
      eyes fell on a notice on the door. There was no necessity to read it, he
      knew its purport: the restaurant was closed on midsummer-day; he had
      forgotten it. He felt as if he had run with his head into a lamp-post. He
      was furious; first of all with the proprietor for closing, then with
      himself for having forgotten that the restaurant would be closed. It
      seemed to him so monstrous that he could have forgotten an incident of
      such importance, that he couldn&rsquo;t believe it and racked his brain to find
      someone on whom he could lay the blame. Of course, it was the fault of the
      proprietor. He had run off the lines, come into collision. He was done. He
      sat down on the seat and almost shed tears of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thump! a ball hit him right in the middle of his starched shirt front.
      Like an infuriated wasp he rose from his seat to find the criminal; a
      plain little girl&rsquo;s face laughed into his; a labourer in his Sunday
      clothes and straw hat appeared, took her by the hand and smilingly
      expressed a hope that the child had not hurt him; a laughing crowd of
      soldiers and servant girls stared at him. He looked round for a constable
      for he felt that his rights as a human being had been encroached upon. But
      when he saw the constable in familiar conversation with the child&rsquo;s
      mother, he dropped the idea of making a scene, went straight to the
      nearest cab-stand, hired a cab, and told the driver to drive him to the
      bookseller&rsquo;s; he could not bear to be alone any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the safe shelter of the cab he took out his handkerchief and flicked
      the dust from his shirt front.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed the cab in Goten Street, for he felt sure that he would find
      his friend at home. But as he walked upstairs his assurance left him.
      Supposing he were out after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was out. Not one of the tenants was at home. His knock sounded through
      an empty house; his footsteps re-echoed on the deserted stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was again in the street he was at a loss to know what to do. He
      did not know Potocki&rsquo;s address, and where was he to find an address book
      on a day when all the shops were closed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without knowing where he was going, he went down the street, past the
      harbour, across the bridge. He did not meet a single man he knew. The
      presence of the crowd which occupied the town during the absence of their
      betters annoyed him, for, like the rest of us, the education which he had
      received at school had made an aristocrat of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first anger he had forgotten his hunger, but now it re-asserted
      itself. A new, terrible thought occurred to him, a thought which up to now
      he had put away from him out of sheer cowardice: Where was he to dine? He
      had started out with plenty of vouchers in his pocket, but only one crown
      and fifty öre in coin. The vouchers were only used at Rejner&rsquo;s, for
      convenience sake, and he had spent a crown on his cabfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself again in Berzelius Park. Everywhere he met labourers and
      their families, eating what they had brought with them in baskets;
      hard-boiled eggs, crabs, pancakes. And the police did not interfere. On
      the contrary, he saw a policeman with a sandwich in one hand and a glass
      of beer in the other. But what irritated him more than anything else was
      the fact that these people whom he despised had the advantage of him. But
      why couldn&rsquo;t he go into a dairy and appease his hunger? Yes, why not? The
      very thought of it made him shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little reflection he went down to the harbour, intending to
      cross over to the Deer Park. He was bound to find acquaintances there from
      whom he could borrow money (hateful thought!) for his dinner. And if so,
      he would dine at &ldquo;Hazelmount,&rdquo; the best restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer was so crowded that schoolmaster Blom had to stand close to
      the engine; the heat at his back was intolerable; his morning coat was
      being covered with grease spots, while he stood, with his gaze rivetted on
      the untidy head of a servant girl and endured the rancid smell of the
      hair-oil. But he did not see a single face he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the restaurant in the Deer Park, he squared his shoulders
      and tried to look as distinguished as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space before the restaurant was like the auditorium of a theatre and
      seemed to serve the same purpose: that is to say, it was a place where one
      met one&rsquo;s friends and showed off. The verandah was occupied by officers,
      blue in the face with eating and drinking; with them were representatives
      of the foreign Powers, grown old and grey in their strenuous efforts to
      protect fellow-countrymen who had got mixed up with sailors and fishermen
      in drunken brawls, or assist at Gala performances, christenings, weddings
      and funerals. So much for the aristocracy. In the centre of a large space
      Mr. Blom suddenly discovered the chimney sweep of his quarter, the
      proprietor of a small inn, the chemist&rsquo;s assistant and others of the same
      standing. He watched the game-keeper in his green coat and silver lace,
      with his gilt staff, walking up and down and casting contemptuous glances
      at the assembled crowd, as if he were wondering why they were here? The
      schoolmaster felt self-conscious under the stare of all those eyes which
      seemed to say: &ldquo;Look at him! there he goes, wondering how to get dinner!&rdquo;
       But there was nothing else for it. He went on to the verandah where the
      people sat eating perch and asparagus, and drinking Sauternes and
      Champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden he felt the pressure of a friendly hand on his shoulder,
      and as he turned round, he found himself face to face with Gustav, the
      waiter, who seized his hand and exclaimed with undisguised pleasure:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that really you, Mr. Blom? How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gustav, the waiter, who was so pleased to find himself for a few
      moments the equal of his master, held a piece of wood in his warm hand and
      met a pair of eyes which pierced his soul like gimlets. And yet this same
      hand had given him ten crowns only yesterday, and the owner of it had
      thanked him for six months&rsquo; service and attention in the way one thanks a
      friend. The waiter went back to his companions and sat down amongst them,
      embarrassed and snubbed. But Mr. Blom left the verandah with bitter
      thoughts and pushed his way through the crowd; he fancied that he could
      hear a mocking: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been able to get dinner, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to a large open space. There was a puppet-show, and Jasper was
      being beaten by his wife. A little further off a sailor was showing
      servant girls, soldiers and apprentices their future husband or wife in a
      wheel of fortune. They all had had dinner and were enjoying themselves;
      for a moment he believed himself their inferior, but only for a moment;
      then he remembered that they had not the vaguest idea of how an Egyptian
      camp was fortified. The thought gave him back his self-respect, and he
      wondered how it was possible that people could be so degraded as to find
      pleasure in such childishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he had lost all inclination to try the other restaurants;
      he passed the Tivoli and went further into the heart of the park. Young
      men and women were dancing on the grass to the strains of a violin: a
      little further off a whole family was camping under an old oak; the head
      of the family was kneeling down, in his shirt sleeves, with bare head, a
      glass of beer in one hand, a sandwich in the other; his fat, jolly,
      clean-shaven face beamed with pleasure and good-nature as he invited his
      guests, who were evidently his wife, parents-in-law, brothers,
      shop-assistants and servants, to eat, drink and be merry, for to-day was
      Midsummer day, all day long. And the jovial fellow made such droll remarks
      that the whole party writhed on the grass with amusement. After the
      pancake had been produced and eaten with the fingers, and the port bottle
      been round, the senior shop-assistant made a speech which was at once so
      moving and so witty that the ladies at one moment pressed their
      handkerchiefs to their eyes, while the head of the family bit his lips,
      and at the next interrupted the speaker with loud laughter and cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster&rsquo;s mood became more and more morose, but instead of going
      away he sat down on a stone under a pinetree and watched &ldquo;the animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the speech was finished and father and mother had been toasted with
      cheers and a flourish of trumpets, executed on a concertina, accompanied
      by the rattling of all cups and saucers that happened to be empty, the
      party rose to play &ldquo;Third Man,&rdquo; while mother and mother-in-law attended to
      the babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like the beasts in the field,&rdquo; thought the schoolmaster, turning
      away, for all that was natural was ugly in his eyes, and only that which
      was unnatural could lay any claim to beauty in his opinion, except, of
      course, the paintings of &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; masters in the National Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the young men taking off their coats, the young girls slipping
      off their cuffs and hanging them on the blackthorn bushes; then they took
      up their positions and the game began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls picked up their skirts and threw up their legs so that their
      garters, made of blue and red braid such as the grocers sell for tying up
      pots, were plainly visible, and whenever the cavalier caught his lady, he
      took her in his arms and swung her round so that her skirts flew; and
      young and old shrieked so with laughter that the park re-echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this innocence or corruption?&rdquo; wondered the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But evidently the party did not know what the learned word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;
       meant, and that was the reason why they were so merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they were tired of playing &ldquo;Third Man&rdquo; tea was ready. The
      schoolmaster was puzzled to know where the cavaliers had learnt their fine
      manners, for they moved about on all fours to offer the girls sugar and
      cake; and the straps of their waistcoats stood out like handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The males showing off before the females!&rdquo; thought the schoolmaster.
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what they are in for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noticed how the head of the family, the jolly fellow, waited on father
      and mother-in-law, wife, shop-assistants and servant girls: and whenever
      one of them begged him to help himself first, he invariably answered that
      there was plenty of time for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the father-in-law peeling a willow branch to make a flute for
      the little boy; he watched the mother-in-law wash up as if she had been
      one of the servants. And he thought that there was something strange about
      selfishness, since it could be so cleverly disguised that it looked as if
      no one gave more than he received; for it must be selfishness, it couldn&rsquo;t
      be anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played at forfeits and redeemed every forfeit with kisses, true,
      genuine, resounding kisses on the lips; and when the jolly book-keeper was
      made to kiss the old oak-tree, his conduct was too absurd for anything; he
      embraced and caressed the gnarled trunk as if it had been a girl whom he
      had met secretly; everybody shouted with laughter, for all knew how to do
      it, although none of them would have liked to be caught doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster who had begun by watching the spectacle with critical
      eyes, fell more and more under the spell of it; he almost believed himself
      to be one of the party. He smiled at the sallies of the shop-assistants,
      and before an hour was gone the head of the family had won his whole
      sympathy. No one could deny that the man was a comedian of the first rank.
      He could play &ldquo;Skin-the-cat&rdquo;; he could &ldquo;walk backwards,&rdquo; &ldquo;lie&rdquo; on the
      tree-trunks, swallow coins, eat fire, and imitate all sorts of birds. And
      when he extracted a saffron cake from the dress of one of the girls and
      made it disappear in his right ear, the schoolmaster laughed until his
      empty inside ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dancing began. The schoolmaster had read in Rabe&rsquo;s grammar: Nemo
      saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit, and had always looked upon dancing as
      a species of insanity. True, he had watched puppies and calves dancing
      when they felt frisky, but he did not believe that Cicero&rsquo;s maxim applied
      to the animal world, and he was in the habit of drawing a sharp line
      between men and animals. Now, as he sat watching these young people who
      were quite sober, and neither hungry nor thirsty, moving round and round
      to the slow measures of the concertina, he felt as if his soul were in a
      swing which was being kept going by his eyes and ears, and his right foot
      beat time gently on the springy turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent three hours musing and watching, then he rose. He found it almost
      difficult to tear himself away; it was just as if he were leaving a merry
      party to which he had been invited; but his mood had changed; he felt more
      reconciled. He was at peace with the world and pleasantly tired, as if he
      had been enjoying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening. Smart carriages passed him, the lady-occupants lolling on
      the back seats and looking in their long, white theatre wraps like corpses
      in their shrouds; it was fashionable then to look as if one had been
      exhumed. The schoolmaster, whose thoughts were running in another
      direction, was sure that the ladies must be bored to death and felt no
      trace of envy. Below the dusty highroad, far out on the sea, the steamers
      with their flags and brass bands were returning from their pleasure trips;
      cheers, strains of music and snatches of song were wafted by the sea
      breezes to the mountains and the Deer Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster had never felt so lonely in his life as he did this
      evening in the moving throng. He fancied that everybody was looking at him
      compassionately as he made his solitary way through the crowd, and almost
      gave way to self-pity. He would have liked to talk to the first comer, for
      the mere pleasure of hearing his voice, for in his loneliness he felt as
      if he were walking by the side of a stranger. And now his conscience smote
      him. He remembered the waiter Gustav, who had been unable to hide his
      pleasure at meeting him. Now he had arrived at a point when he would have
      given worlds if anybody had met him and shown any pleasure at the fact.
      But nobody came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, somebody did, after all. As he was sitting by himself on the steamer,
      a setter, who had lost his master, came to him and put its head on his
      knee. The schoolmaster was not particularly fond of dogs, but he allowed
      it to stay; he felt it pressing its soft warm body against his leg, he saw
      the eyes of the forsaken brute looking at him in dumb appeal, as if it
      were asking him to find its master.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as they landed, the setter ran away. &ldquo;It needed me no longer,&rdquo;
       thought the schoolmaster, and he walked home and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These trifling incidents of Midsummer day had robbed the schoolmaster of
      his assurance. They taught him that all foresight, all precautions, all
      the clever calculations in the world availed nothing. He felt a certain
      instability in his surroundings. Even the public house, his home, was not
      to be counted on. It might be closed any day. Moreover, a certain reserve
      on the part of Gustav troubled him. The waiter was as civil as before,
      more attentive even, but his friendship was gone; he had lost confidence.
      It afforded the schoolmaster food for thought, and whenever a tough piece
      of meat, or too small a dish of potatoes was set before him he thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haha! He&rsquo;s paying me out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a bad summer for the schoolmaster: the second violin was out of
      town and the book-seller frequented &ldquo;Mosesheight,&rdquo; a garden restaurant in
      his own district, situated on a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an evening in autumn the bookseller and the second violin were sitting
      at their favourite table, drinking a glass of punch, when the schoolmaster
      entered, carrying under his arm a parcel which he carefully hid in an
      empty hamper in a cupboard used for all sorts of lumber. He was
      ill-tempered and unusually irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old boy,&rdquo; the bookseller began for the hundredth time, &ldquo;and when
      are you going to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound your &lsquo;when are you going to be married!&rsquo; As if a man hadn&rsquo;t
      enough trouble without it! Why don&rsquo;t you get married yourself?&rdquo; growled
      the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! because I have my old Stafva,&rdquo; answered the bookseller, who always
      had a number of stereotyped answers in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was married very happily,&rdquo; said the Pole, &ldquo;but my wife is dead, now,
      ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; mimicked the schoolmaster; &ldquo;and the gentleman is a widower? How
      am I to reconcile these facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole nodded, for he did not in the least understand what the
      schoolmaster was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter felt bored by his friends; their topic of conversation was
      always the same; he knew their replies by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he went into the corridor for a few moments to fetch his
      cigar-case which he had left in the pocket of his overcoat. The bookseller
      instantly raided the cupboard and returned with the mysterious parcel. As
      it was not sealed, he opened it quickly; it contained a beautiful American
      sleeping-suit; he hung it carefully over the back of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the Pole, grinning, as if he were looking at something
      unsightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor of the restaurant who loved a practical joke, bent over the
      counter, laughing loudly; the waiter stood rooted to the spot, and one of
      the cooks peeped through the door which communicated with the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the schoolmaster came back and realised the trick played on him, he
      grew pale with anger; he immediately suspected the bookseller; but when
      his eyes fell on Gustav who was standing in a corner of the room,
      laughing, his old obsession returned to him: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s paying me out!&rdquo; Without
      a word he seized his property, threw a few coins on the counter and left
      the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the schoolmaster avoided Rejner&rsquo;s. The bookseller had heard
      that he dined at a restaurant in his own district. This was true. But he
      was very discontented! The food was not actually bad, but it was not
      cooked to his liking. The waiters were not attentive. He often thought of
      returning to Rejner&rsquo;s, but his pride would not let him. He had been turned
      out of his home; in five minutes a bond of many years&rsquo; standing had been
      severed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after fate struck him a fresh blow. Miss Augusta had
      inherited a little fortune in the provinces and had decided to leave
      Stockholm on the first of October. The schoolmaster had to look out for
      new lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had been spoilt, and there was no pleasing him. He changed his room
      every month. There was nothing wrong with the rooms, but they were not
      like his old room. It had become such a habit with him to walk through
      certain streets, that he often found himself before his old front door
      before he realised his mistake. He was like a lost child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually he went to live in a boarding house, a solution which he had
      always loathed and dreaded. And then his friends lost sight of him
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as the Pole was sitting alone over his grog, smoking,
      drinking, and nodding with the capacity of the oriental to lapse into
      complete stupor, the bookseller burst in on him like a thunderstorm, flung
      his hat on the table, and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him! Has anybody ever heard anything like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole roused himself from his brandy-and-tobacco Nirvana, and rolled
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, confound it! Has anybody ever heard anything like it? He&rsquo;s going
      to be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to be married?&rdquo; asked the Pole, startled by the bookseller&rsquo;s
      violence and emphatic language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schoolmaster Blom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bookseller expected a glass of grog in exchange for his news. The
      proprietor left the counter and came to their table to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she any money?&rdquo; he asked acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the bookseller, conscious of his temporary
      importance and selling his wares one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she beautiful?&rdquo; asked the Pole. &ldquo;My wife was very beautiful. Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not beautiful either,&rdquo; answered the bookseller, &ldquo;but
      nice-looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo; enquired the proprietor. &ldquo;Is she old?&rdquo; His eyes
      wandered towards the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her parents?&rdquo; continued the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that her father was a brass founder in Orebro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal! Well, I never!&rdquo; said the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I always said so? The man is a born husband,&rdquo; said the
      bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all of us are,&rdquo; said the proprietor, &ldquo;and take my word for it, no one
      escapes his fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this philosophical remark he closed the subject and returned to the
      counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had settled that the schoolmaster was not marrying for money,
      they discussed the problem of &ldquo;what the young people were going to live
      on.&rdquo; The bookseller made a guess at the schoolmaster&rsquo;s salary and &ldquo;what he
      might earn besides by giving private lessons.&rdquo; When that question, too,
      had been settled, the proprietor, who had returned to the table, asked for
      details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where had he met her? Was she fair or dark? Was she in love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last question was by no means out of the way; the bookseller &ldquo;thought
      she was,&rdquo; for he had seen them together, arm in arm, looking into shop
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that he, who was such a stick, could fall in love! It was
      incredible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a husband he would make!&rdquo; The proprietor knew that he was <i>devilish
      particular</i> about his food, and that, he said, was a mistake when one
      was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he likes a glass of punch in the evening, and surely a married man
      can&rsquo;t drink punch every evening of his life. And he doesn&rsquo;t like children!
      It won&rsquo;t turn out well,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Take my word for it, it won&rsquo;t turn
      out well. And, gentlemen, there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; (he rose from his seat,
      looked round and continued in a whisper), &ldquo;I believe, I&rsquo;m hanged if I
      don&rsquo;t, that the old hypocrite has had a love affair of some sort. Do you
      remember that incident, gentlemen, with the&mdash;hihihi&mdash;sleeping
      suit? He&rsquo;s one of those whom you don&rsquo;t find where you leave them! Take
      care, Mrs. Blom! Mind what you are about! I&rsquo;ll say no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly a fact that the schoolmaster was engaged to be married
      and that the wedding was to take place within two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened after, does not belong to this story, and, moreover, it is
      difficult to know what goes on behind the convent walls of domesticity
      when the vow of silence is being kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also a fact that the schoolmaster, after his marriage, was never
      again seen at a public house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookseller, who met him by himself in the street one evening, had to
      listen to a long exhortation on getting married. The schoolmaster had
      inveighed against all bachelors; he had called them egotists, who refused
      to do their duty by the State; in his opinion they ought to be heavily
      taxed, for all indirect taxes weighed most cruelly on the father of a
      family. He went so far as to say that he wished to see bachelorhood
      punished by the law of the land as a &ldquo;crime against nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bookseller had a good memory. He said that he doubted the advisability
      of taking a <i>fool</i> into one&rsquo;s house, permanently. But the
      schoolmaster replied that <i>his</i> wife was the most intelligent woman
      he had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years after the wedding the Pole saw the schoolmaster and his wife in
      the theatre; he thought that they looked happy; &ldquo;ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another three years went by. On a Midsummer day the proprietor of the
      restaurant made a pleasure trip on the Lake of Mälar to Mariafred. There,
      before Castle Cripsholm, he saw the schoolmaster, pushing a perambulator
      over a green field, and carrying in his disengaged hand a basket
      containing food, while a whole crowd of young men and women, &ldquo;who looked
      like country folk,&rdquo; followed in the rear. After dinner the schoolmaster
      sang songs and turned somersaults with the youngsters. He looked ten years
      younger and had all the ways of a ladies&rsquo; man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor, who was quite close to the party while they were having
      dinner, overheard a little conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Blom. When
      the young wife took a dish of crabs from the basket, she apologised to
      Albert, because she had not been able to buy a single female crab in the
      whole market. Thereupon the schoolmaster put his arm round her, kissed her
      and said that it didn&rsquo;t matter in the least, because male or female crabs,
      it was all the same to him. And when one of the babies in the perambulator
      began to cry, the schoolmaster lifted it out and hushed it to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, all these things are mere details, but how people can get married
      and bring up a family when they have not enough for themselves while they
      are bachelors, is a riddle to me. It almost looks as if babies brought
      their food with them when they come into this world; it really almost does
      look as if they did.

    <h2>
      COMPENSATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was considered a genius at College, and no one doubted that he would
      one day distinguish himself. But after passing his examinations, he was
      obliged to go to Stockholm and look out for a berth. His dissertation,
      which was to win him the doctor&rsquo;s degree, had to be postponed. As he was
      very ambitious, but had no private means, he resolved to marry money, and
      with this object in view, he visited only the very best families, both at
      Upsala where he studied for the bar, and later on at Stockholm. At Upsala
      he always fraternised with the new arrivals, that is to say, when they
      were members of aristocratic families, and the freshers felt flattered by
      the advances made by the older man. In this way he formed many useful
      ties, which meant invitations to his friends&rsquo; country houses during the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country houses were his happy hunting ground. He possessed social
      talents, he could sing and play and amuse the ladies, and consequently he
      was a great favourite. He dressed beyond his means; but he never borrowed
      money from any of his friends or aristocratic acquaintances. He even went
      to the length of buying two worthless shares and mentioning on every
      possible occasion that he had to attend a General Meeting of the
      shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two summers he had paid a great deal of attention to a titled lady who
      owned some property, and his prospects were the general topic, when he
      suddenly disappeared from high life and became engaged to a poor girl, the
      daughter of a cooper, who owned no property whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends were puzzled and could not understand how he could thus stand
      in his own light. He had laid his plans so well, he &ldquo;had but to stretch
      out his hand and success was in his grasp&rdquo;; he had the morsel firmly stuck
      on his fork, it was only necessary for him to open his mouth and swallow
      it. He himself was at a loss to understand how it was that the face of a
      little girl whom he had met but once on a steamer could have upset all his
      plans of many years&rsquo; standing. He was bewitched, obsessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked his friends whether they didn&rsquo;t think her beautiful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly speaking they didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is so clever! Just look into her eyes! What expressive eyes she
      has!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friends could see nothing and hear less, for the girl never opened her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he spent evening after evening with the cooper&rsquo;s family; to be sure,
      the cooper was a very intelligent man! On his knees before her (a trick
      often practised at the country houses) he held her skeins of wool; he
      played and sang to her, talked about religion and the drama, and he always
      read acquiescence in her eyes. He wrote poetry about her, and sacrificed
      at her shrine his laurels, his ambitious dreams, even his dissertation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cooper drank too much at the wedding and made an improper speech about
      girls in general. But the son-in-law found the old man so unsophisticated,
      so amiable, that he egged him on instead of shutting him up. He felt at
      his ease among these simple folk; in their midst he could be quite
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s being in love,&rdquo; said his friends. &ldquo;Love is a wonderful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now they were married. One month&mdash;two months. He was unspeakably
      happy. Every evening they spent together and he sang a song to her about
      the Rose in the Wood, her favourite song. And he talked about religion and
      the drama, and she sat and listened eagerly. But she never expressed an
      opinion; she listened in silence and went on with her crochet work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third month he relapsed into his old habit of taking an afternoon
      nap. His wife, who hated being by herself, insisted on sitting by him. It
      irritated him, for he felt an overwhelming need to be alone with his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she met him on his way home from his office, and her heart
      swelled with pride when he left his colleagues and crossed the street to
      join her. She took him home in triumph: he was <i>her</i> husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fourth month he grew tired of her favourite song. It was stale now!
      He took up a book and read, and neither of them spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he had to attend a meeting which was followed by a banquet. It
      was his first night away from home. He had persuaded his wife to invite a
      friend to spend the evening with her, and to go to bed early, for he did
      not expect to be home until late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend came and stayed until nine o&rsquo;clock. The young wife sat in the
      drawing-room, waiting, for she was determined not to go to bed until her
      husband had returned. She felt too restless to go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat alone in the drawing-room. What could she do to make the time pass
      more quickly? The maid had gone to bed; the grandfather&rsquo;s clock ticked and
      ticked. But it was only ten o&rsquo;clock when she put away her crochet work.
      She fidgeted, moved the furniture about and felt a little unstrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was what being married meant! One was torn from one&rsquo;s early
      surroundings, and shut up in three solitary rooms to wait until one&rsquo;s
      husband came home, half intoxicated.&mdash;Nonsense! he loved her, and he
      was out on business. She was a fool to forget that. But <i>did</i> he love
      her still? Hadn&rsquo;t he refused a day or two ago to hold a skein of wool for
      her?&mdash;a thing he loved to do before they were married. Didn&rsquo;t he look
      rather annoyed yesterday when she met him before lunch? And&mdash;after
      all&mdash;if he had to attend a business meeting to-night, there was no
      necessity for him to be present at the banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past ten when her musing had reached this point. She was
      surprised that she hadn&rsquo;t thought of these things before. She relapsed
      into her dark mood and the dismal thoughts again passed through her mind,
      one by one. But now reinforcements had arrived. He never talked to her
      now! He never sang to her, never opened the piano! He had told her a lie
      when he had said that he couldn&rsquo;t do without his afternoon nap, for he was
      reading French novels all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told her a lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only half-past eleven. The silence was oppressive. She opened the
      window and looked out into the street. Two men were standing down below,
      bargaining with two women. That was men&rsquo;s way! If he should ever do
      anything like that! She should drown herself if he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut the window and lighted the chandelier in the bedroom. &ldquo;One ought
      to be able to see what one is about,&rdquo; he had once said to her on a certain
      occasion.&mdash;Everything was still so bright and new! The green coverlet
      looked like a mown lawn, and the little pillows reminded her of two white
      kittens curled up on the grass. The polish of her dressing-table reflected
      the light: the mirror had as yet none of those ugly stains which are made
      by the splashing of water. The silver on the back of her hair-brush, her
      powder-box, her tooth-brush, all shone and sparkled. Her bedroom slippers
      were still so new and pretty that it was impossible to picture them
      down-at-heel. Everything looked new, and yet everything seemed to have
      lost some of its freshness. She knew all his songs, all his drawing-room
      pieces, all his words, all his thoughts. She knew before-hand what he
      would say when he sat down to lunch, what he would talk about when they
      were alone in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sick of it all. Had she been in love with him? Oh, yes! Certainly!
      But was this all then? Was she realising all the dreams of her girlhood?
      Were things to go on like this until she died? Yes! But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;surely
      they would have children! though there was no sign of it as yet. Then she
      would no longer be alone! Then he might go out as often as he liked, for
      she would always have somebody to talk to, to play with. Perhaps it was a
      baby which she wanted to make her happy. Perhaps matrimony really meant
      something more than being a man&rsquo;s legitimate mistress. That must be it!
      But then, he would have to love her, and he didn&rsquo;t do that. And she began
      to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her husband came home at one o&rsquo;clock, he was quite sober. But he was
      almost angry with her when he found her still up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go to bed?&rdquo; were the words with which he greeted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I go to sleep when I am waiting for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine look out for me! Am I never to go out then? I believe you have
      been crying, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have, and how can I help it if you&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;love&mdash;me&mdash;any&mdash;more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say I don&rsquo;t love you because I had to go out on business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A banquet isn&rsquo;t business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Am I not to be allowed to go out? How can women be so
      obtrusive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obtrusive? Yes, I noticed that yesterday, when I met you. I&rsquo;ll never meet
      you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, darling, I was with my chief&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huhuhu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears, her body moved convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to call the maid and ask her to fetch the hot-water bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was weeping. Scalding tears! He wept over himself, his hardness
      of heart, his wickedness, his illusions over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely his love for her wasn&rsquo;t an illusion? He did love her! Didn&rsquo;t he?
      And she said she loved him, too, as he was kneeling before her prostrate
      figure, kissing her eyes. Yes, they loved one another! It was merely a
      dark cloud which had passed, now. Ugly thoughts, born of solitude and
      loneliness. She would never, never again stay alone. They fell asleep in
      each other&rsquo;s arms, her face dimpled with smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not go to meet him on the following day. He asked no questions
      at lunch. He talked a lot, but more for the sake of talking than to amuse
      her; it seemed as if he were talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he entertained her with long descriptions of the life at
      Castle Sjöstaholm; he mimicked the young ladies talking to the Baron, and
      told her the names of the Count&rsquo;s horses. And on the following day he
      mentioned his dissertation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he came home very tired. She was sitting in the
      drawing-room, waiting for him. Her ball of cotton had fallen on the floor.
      In passing, his foot got entangled in the cotton; at his next step he
      pulled her crochet work out of her hand and dragged it along; then he lost
      his temper and kicked it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She exclaimed at his rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retorted that he had no time to bother about her rubbish, and advised
      her to spend her time more profitably. He had to think of his
      dissertation, if he was to have a career at all. And she ought to consider
      the question of how to limit their household expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things had gone far indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day the young wife, her eyes swollen with weeping, was
      knitting socks for her husband. He told her he could buy them cheaper
      ready-made. She burst into tears. What was she to do? The maid did all the
      work of the house, there was not enough work in the kitchen for two. She
      always dusted the rooms. Did he want her to send the maid away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he want, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t know himself, but he was sure that something was wrong. Their
      expenses were too high. That was all. They couldn&rsquo;t go on living at their
      present rate, and then&mdash;somehow he could never find time to work at
      his dissertation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears, kisses, and a grand reconciliation! But now he started staying away
      from home in the evening several times a week. Business! A man must show
      himself! If he stays at home, he will be overlooked and forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed; there were no signs of the arrival of a baby. &ldquo;How like
      a little liaison I once had in the old days,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;there is only
      one difference: this one is duller and costs more.&rdquo; There was no more
      conversation, now; they merely talked of household matters. &ldquo;She has no
      brain,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I am listening to myself when I am talking to her,
      and the apparent depths of her eyes is a delusion, due to the size of her
      pupils&mdash;the unusual size of her pupils.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He talked openly about his former love for her as of something that was
      over and done with. And yet, whenever he did so, he felt a pain in his
      heart, an irritating, cruel pain, a remorseless pain that could never die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything on earth withers and dies,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;why should her
      favourite song alone be an exception to this? When one has heard it three
      hundred and sixty-five times, it becomes stale; it can&rsquo;t be helped. But is
      my wife right when she says that our love, also, has died? No, and yet&mdash;perhaps
      she is. Our marriage is no better than a vulgar liaison, for we have no
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day he made up his mind to talk the matter over with a married friend,
      for were they not both members of the &ldquo;Order of the Married&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does matrimony bore you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first it did; but when the children came, matters improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that so? It&rsquo;s strange that we have no child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your fault, old man! Tell your wife to go and see a doctor about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had an intimate conversation with her and she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six weeks after what a change!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a bustle and commotion in the house! The drawing-room table was
      littered with baby-clothes which were quickly hidden if anybody entered
      unexpectedly, and reappeared as quickly if it was only he who had come in.
      A name had to be thought of. It would surely be a boy. The midwife had to
      be interviewed, medical books had to be bought, and a cradle and a baby&rsquo;s
      outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby arrived and it really was a boy! And when he saw the &ldquo;little
      monkey that smelled of butter&rdquo; clasped to her bosom, which until then had
      but been his plaything, he reverently discovered the mother in his little
      wife; and &ldquo;when he saw the big pupils looking at the baby so intently that
      they seemed to be looking into the future&rdquo;, he realised that there were
      depths in her eyes after all; depths more profound than he could fathom
      for all his drama and religion. And now all his old love, his dear old
      love, burst into fresh flames, and there was something new added to it,
      which he had dimly divined, but never realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      How beautiful she was when she busied herself about the house again! And
      how intelligent in all matters concerning the baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for him, he felt a man. Instead of talking of the Baron&rsquo;s horses and
      the Count&rsquo;s cricket matches, he now talked, too much almost, of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when occasionally he was obliged to be out of an evening, he always
      longed for his own fireside; not because his wife sat there waiting for
      him, like an evil conscience, but because he knew that she was not alone.
      And when he came home, both mother and child were asleep. He was almost
      jealous of the baby, for there had been a certain charm in the thought
      that while he was out, somebody was sitting alone at home, eagerly
      awaiting his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was allowed his afternoon nap. And as soon as he had gone back to
      town, the piano was opened and the favourite song of the <i>Rose in the
      Wood</i> was sung, for it was quite new to Harold, and had regained all
      its freshness for poor little Laura who hadn&rsquo;t heard it for so many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no time now for crochet work, but there were plenty of
      antimacassars in the house. He, on his part, could not spare the time for
      his dissertation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold shall write it,&rdquo; said the father, for he knew now that his life
      would not be over when he came to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many an evening they sat together, as before, and gossiped, but now both
      took a share in the conversation, for now she understood what they were
      talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      She confessed that she was a silly girl who knew nothing about religion
      and the drama; but she said that she had always told him so, and that he
      had refused to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he believed it less than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sang the old favourite song, and Harold crowed, they danced to the
      tune and rocked the baby&rsquo;s cradle to it, and the song always retained its
      freshness and charm.

      FRICTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      His eyes had been opened. He realised the perversity of the world, but he
      lacked the power to penetrate the darkness and discover the cause of this
      perversity; therefore he gave himself up to despair, a disillusioned man.
      Then he fell in love with a girl who married somebody else. He complained
      of her conduct to his friends, male and female, but they only laughed at
      him. For a little while longer he trod his solitary path alone and
      misunderstood. He belonged to &ldquo;society,&rdquo; and joined in its pursuits,
      because it distracted him; but at the bottom of his heart he had nothing
      but contempt for its amusements, which he took no pains to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he was present at a ball. He danced with a young woman of
      unusual beauty and animation. When the band ceased playing, he remained
      standing by her side. He knew he ought to talk to her but he did not know
      what to say. After a while the girl broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of dancing, Baron?&rdquo; she said with a cold, smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! not at all,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more foolish,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had met his man, or rather his woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you dance, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason that you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you read my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough; if two people think alike, the other always knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! You&rsquo;re a strange woman! Do you believe in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I! You and I ought to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think so myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? At any rate, we shouldn&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible idea! But how can you be so sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we think alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that might become monotonous. We should have nothing to talk
      about, because the one would always know what the other is thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but wouldn&rsquo;t it be even more monotonous if we remained unmarried
      and misunderstood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right! Would you like to think it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, until the cotillon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her back to the drawing-room and left her there, drank several
      glasses of champagne and watched her during supper. She allowed two young
      members of the Diplomatic Corps to wait on her, but made fun of them all
      the time and treated them as if they were footmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the cotillon began, he went to her and offered her a bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you accept me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they were engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a splendid match, said the world. They are made for one another. They
      are equals as far as social position and money are concerned. They hold
      the same blasé views of life. By blasé the world meant that they cared
      very little for dances, theatres, bazaars, and other noble sports without
      which life is not really worth living.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were like carefully wiped twin slates, exactly alike; but utterly
      unable to surmise whether or not life would write the same legend on both.
      They never asked one another during the tender moments of their
      engagement: Do you love me? They knew quite well that it was impossible,
      because they did not believe in love. They talked little, but they
      understood one another perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they married.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always attentive, always polite, and they were good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the baby was born, it had but one effect on their relationship; they
      had something to talk about now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by-and-by the husband began to reveal a certain energy. He had a sense
      of duty, and moreover, he was sick of being idle. He had a private income,
      but was in no way connected with politics or the Government. Now he looked
      round for some occupation which would fill the void in his life. He had
      heard the first morning call of the awakening spirits and felt it his duty
      to do his share of the great work of research into the causes of human
      misery. He read much, made a careful study of politics and eventually
      wrote an article and sent it to a paper. The consequence was that he was
      elected a member of the Board of Education. This necessitated hard reading
      in future, for all questions were to be threshed out thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness lay on the sofa and read Chateaubriand and Musset. She had no
      faith in the improvement of humanity, and this stirring up of the dust and
      mould which the centuries had deposited on human institutions irritated
      her. Yet she noticed that she did not keep pace with her husband. They
      were like two horses at a race. They had been weighed before the start and
      been found to be of the same weight; they had promised to keep side by
      side during the run; everything was calculated to make them finish the
      race and leave the course at the same time. But already the husband had
      gained by the length of a neck. Unless she hurried up, she was bound to be
      left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the latter really happened. In the following year he was made
      controller of the budget. He was away for two months. His absence made the
      Baroness realise that she loved him; a fact which was brought home to her
      by her fear of losing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned home, she was all eagerness; but his mind was filled with
      the things he had seen and heard abroad. He realised that they had come to
      the parting of the ways, but he would have liked to delay it, prevent it,
      if possible. He showed her in great living pictures the functioning of the
      colossal gigantic machinery of the State, he tried to explain to her the
      working of the wheels, the multifarious transmissions, regulators and
      detents, unreliable pendulums and untrustworthy safety valves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was interested at first, but after a while her interest waned.
      Conscious of her mental inferiority, her insignificance, she devoted
      herself entirely to her baby, anxious to demonstrate to her husband that
      she yet had a value as a model mother. But her husband did not appreciate
      this value. He had married her for the sake of companionship, and he found
      in her an excellent nurse for his child. But how could it be helped now?
      Who could have foreseen such a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was always full of members of Parliament, and politics was the
      subject of conversation at dinner. The hostess merely took care that no
      fault could be found with the cooking. The Baron never omitted to have one
      or two men amongst his guests who could talk to his wife about music and
      the drama, but the Baroness wanted to discuss nothing but the nursery and
      the bringing up of children. After dessert, as soon as the health of the
      hostess was drunk, there was a general stampede to the smoking-room where
      the political discussions were continued. The Baroness left her guests and
      went to the nursery with a feeling of bitterness in her heart; she
      realised that her husband had so far outdistanced her that she could never
      again hope to come up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked much at home in the evening; frequently he was busy at his
      writing-table until the small hours of the morning, but always behind
      locked doors. When he noticed afterwards, as he sometimes did, that his
      wife went about with red eyes, he felt a pain in his heart; but they had
      nothing to say to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally however, at those times when his work palled, when he
      realised that his inner life was growing poorer and poorer, he felt a void
      within him, a longing for warmth, for something intimate, something he had
      dreamed of long ago, in the early days of his youth. But every feeling of
      that sort he suppressed at once as unfaithfulness to his wife, for he had
      a very high conception of the duty of a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring a little more variety into her daily life, he suggested one day
      that she should invite a cousin of whom she had often spoken, but whom he
      had never seen, to spend the winter with them in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had always been a great wish of the Baroness&rsquo;s, but now that the
      realisation of it was within her power, she changed her mind. She did not
      want her in the least now. Her husband pressed her for reasons, but she
      could not give him any. It roused his curiosity and finally she confessed
      that she was afraid of her cousin; afraid that she might win his heart,
      that he might fall in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a queer girl, we really must have her here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness wept and warned, but the Baron laughed and the cousin
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon the Baron came home, tired as usual; he had forgotten all
      about the cousin and his curiosity in regard to her. They sat down to
      dinner. The Baron asked the cousin if she was fond of the theatre. She
      replied that she was not. She preferred reality to make-believe. At home
      she had founded a school for black sheep and a society for the care of
      discharged prisoners. Indeed! The Baron was much interested in the
      administration of prisons. The cousin was able to give him a good deal of
      information, and during the rest of the dinner the conversation was
      exclusively about prisons. Eventually the cousin promised to treat the
      whole question in a paper which the Baron was going to read and work up.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the Baroness had foreseen, happened. The Baron contracted a spiritual
      marriage with the cousin, and his wife was left out in the cold. But the
      cousin was also beautiful, and when she leaned over the Baron at his
      writing-desk, and he felt her soft arm on his shoulder and her warm breath
      against his cheek, he could not suppress a sensation of supreme
      well-being. Needless to say, their conversation was not always of prisons.
      They also discussed love. She believed in the love of the souls, and she
      stated as plainly as she could, that marriage without love was
      prostitution. The Baron had not taken much interest in the development of
      modern ideas on love, and found that her views on the subject were rather
      hard, but after all she was probably quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cousin possessed other qualities, too, invaluable qualifications
      for a true spiritual marriage. She had no objection to tobacco smoke for
      instance, in fact, she was very fond of a cigarette herself. There was no
      reason, therefore, why she should not go into the smoking-room with the
      men after dinner and talk about politics. And then she was charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tortured by little twinges of conscience, the Baron would every now and
      then disappear from the smoking-room, go into the nursery, kiss his wife
      and child, and ask her how she was getting on? The Baroness was grateful,
      but she was not happy. After these little journeys the Baron always
      returned to his friends in the best of tempers; one might have thought
      that he had faithfully performed a sacred duty. At other times it
      irritated and distressed him that his wife did not join the party in the
      smoking-room, too, as <i>his</i> wife; this thought was a burden which
      weighed quite heavily on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousin did not go home in the spring, but accompanied the couple to a
      watering-place. There she organised little performances for the benefit of
      the poor, in which she and the Baron played the parts of the lovers. This
      had the inevitable result that the fire burst into flames. But the flames
      were only spiritual flames; mutual interests, like views, and, perhaps,
      similar dispositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness had ample time to consider her position. The day arrived when
      she told her husband that since everything was over between them, the only
      decent thing to do was to part. But that was more than he had bargained
      for; he was miserable; the cousin had better return to her parents, and he
      would prove to his wife that he was a man of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousin left. A correspondence between her and the Baron began. He made
      the Baroness read every letter, however much she hated doing it. After a
      while, however, he gave in and read the letters without showing them to
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the cousin returned. Then matters came to a crisis. The Baron
      discovered that he could not live without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were they to do? Separate? It would be death. Go on as at present?
      Impossible! Annul the marriage which the Baron had come to look upon as
      legal prostitution and marry his beloved? However painful it might be, it
      was the only honest course to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was against the wishes of the cousin. She did not want it said of
      her that she had stolen another woman&rsquo;s husband. And then the scandal! the
      scandal!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was dishonest not to tell his wife everything; it was dishonest to
      allow things to go on; one could never tell how the matter would end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he mean? How could it end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How dared he! What did he think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she was a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he fell on his knees and worshipped her; he said that he did not care
      if the administration of prisons and the school for black sheep went to
      the devil; he did not know what manner of woman she was; he only knew that
      he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she had nothing but contempt for him, and went helter
      skelter to Paris. He followed at her heels. At Hamburg he wrote a letter
      to his wife in which he said that they had made a mistake and that it was
      immoral not to rectify it. He asked her to divorce him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she divorced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after these events the Baron and the cousin were married. They had
      a child. But that was a fact which did not interfere with their happiness.
      On the contrary! What a wealth of new ideas germinated in their minds in
      their voluntary exile! How strong were the winds which blew here!
    </p>
    <p>
      He encouraged her to write a book on &ldquo;young criminals.&rdquo; The press tore it
      to pieces. She was furious and swore that she would never write another
      book. He asked her whether she wrote for praise, whether she was
      ambitious?&mdash;She replied by a question: Why did he write?&mdash;A
      little quarrel arose. He said it was refreshing to hear her express views
      which did not echo his own&mdash;always his own.&mdash;Always his own?
      What did he mean? Didn&rsquo;t she have <i>views of her own</i>? She henceforth
      made it her business to prove to him on every occasion that she was
      capable of forming her own opinions; and to prevent any errors on his part
      she took good care that they always differed from his. He told her he did
      not care what views she held as long as she loved him.&mdash;Love? What
      about it? He was no better than other men and, moreover, he had betrayed
      her. He did not love her soul, but her body.&mdash;No, he loved both, he
      loved her, every bit of her!&mdash;Oh! How deceitful he had been!&mdash;No,
      he had not been deceitful, he had merely deceived himself when he believed
      that he loved her soul only.

      They were tired of strolling up and down the boulevard, and sat down
      before a cafe. She lighted a cigarette. A waiter requested her rather
      uncivilly, not to smoke. The Baron demanded an explanation and the waiter
      said that the cafe was a first-class establishment and the management was
      anxious not to drive away respectable people by serving <i>these ladies</i>.
      They rose from their seats, paid and went away. The Baron was furious, the
      young Baroness had tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they had a demonstration of the power of prejudice! Smoking was a
      foolish act as far as a man was concerned, but in a woman it was a crime!
      Let him who was able to do so, destroy this prejudice! Or, let us say, him
      who would care to do so! The Baron had no wish that his wife should be the
      first victim, even if it were to win for her the doubtful honour of having
      cast aside a prejudice. For it was nothing else. In Russia, ladies
      belonging to the best society smoked at the dinner-table during the
      courses. Customs changed with the latitudes. And yet those trifles were
      not without importance, for life consisted of trifles. If men and women
      shared bad habits, intercourse between them would be less stiff and
      formal: they would make friends more easily and keep pace with one
      another. If they had the same education, they would have the same
      interests, and cling together more closely during the whole of their
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was silent as if he had said something foolish. But she had not
      been listening to him; her thoughts had been far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had been insulted by a waiter, told that she was not fit to associate
      with respectable people. There was more behind that, than appeared on the
      surface. She had been recognised. Yes, she was sure of it, it was not the
      first time that she had noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had she noticed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she had been treated with little respect at the restaurants. The
      people evidently did not think that they were married; because they were
      affectionate and civil to one another. She had borne it in silence for a
      long time, but now she had come to the end of her tether. And yet this was
      nothing compared to what they were saying at home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what were they saying? And why had she never told him anything
      about it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! horrible things! The letters she had received! Leaving the anonymous
      ones quite out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what about him? Was he not being treated as if he were a
      criminal? And yet he had not committed a crime! He had acted according to
      all legal requirements, he had not broken his marriage vows. He had left
      the country in compliance with the dictates of the law; the Royal
      Consistory has granted his appeal for a divorce; the clergy, Holy Church,
      had given him his release from the bonds of his first marriage on stamped
      paper; therefore he had not broken them! When a country was conquered, a
      whole nation was absolved from its oath of loyalty to its monarch; why did
      society look askance at the release from a promise? Had it not conferred
      the right on the Consistory to dissolve a marriage? How could it dare to
      assume the character of a judge now and condemn its own laws? Society was
      at war with itself! He was being treated like a criminal! Hadn&rsquo;t the
      secretary of the Embassy, his old friend, on whom he had left his and his
      wife&rsquo;s cards, acknowledged them by simply returning one card only? And was
      he not overlooked at all public functions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! She had had to put up with worse things! One of her friends in Paris
      had closed her door to her, and several had cut her in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the wearer of a boot knew where it pinched. The boots which they
      were wearing now were real Spanish boots, and they were at war with
      society. The upper classes had cut them. The upper classes! This community
      of semi-imbeciles, who secretly lived like dogs, but showed one another
      respect as long as there was no public scandal; that was to say as long as
      one did not honestly revoke an agreement and wait until it had lapsed
      before one made use of one&rsquo;s newly-regained freedom! And these vicious
      upper classes were the awarders of social position and respect, according
      to a scale on which honesty ranked far below zero. Society was nothing but
      a tissue of lies! It was inexplicable that it hadn&rsquo;t been found out long
      ago! It was high time to examine this fine structure and inquire into the
      condition of its foundations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were on friendlier terms on arriving home than they had been for many
      years. The Baroness stayed at home with her baby, and was soon expecting a
      second one. This struggle against the tide was too hard for her, and she
      was already growing tired of it. She was tired of everything! To write in
      an elegantly furnished, well-heated room on the subject of discharged
      prisoners, offering them, at a proper distance, a well-gloved hand, was a
      proceeding society approved of; but to hold out the hand of friendship to
      a woman who had married a legally divorced man was quite another thing.
      Why should it be so? It was difficult to find an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron fought in the thick of the battle. He visited the Chamber of
      Deputies, was present at meetings, and everywhere he listened to
      passionate diatribes against society. He read papers and magazines, kept a
      keen eye on literature, studied the subject deeply. His wife was
      threatened by the same fate which had overtaken the first one; to be left
      behind! It was strange. She seemed unable to take in all the details of
      his investigations, she disapproved of much of the new doctrine, but she
      felt that he was right and fighting for a good cause. He knew that he
      could always count on her never-flagging sympathy; that he had a friend at
      home who would always stand by him. Their common fate drove them into each
      other&rsquo;s arms like frightened birds at the approach of a storm. All the
      womanliness in her,&mdash;however little it may be appreciated now-a-days,&mdash;which
      is after all nothing but a memory of the great mother, the force of nature
      which is woman&rsquo;s endowment, was roused. It fell on the children like the
      warm glow of a fire at eventide; it fell on the husband like a ray of
      sunshine; it brought peace to the home. He often wondered how it was that
      he did not miss his old comrade, with whom he was wont to discuss
      everything; he discovered that his thoughts had gained force and vigour
      since he stopped pouring them out as soon as he conceived them; it seemed
      to him that he was profiting more by the silent approval, the kindly nod,
      the unwavering sympathy. He felt that his strength had increased, that his
      views were less under outside control; he was a solitary man, now, and yet
      he was less solitary than he had been in the past, for he was no longer
      constantly met by contradictions which merely filled his heart with
      misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Eve in Paris. A large Christmas tree, grown in the wood
      of St. Germain, stood in their little chalet on the Cours de la Reine.
      They were going out after breakfast to buy Christmas presents for the
      children. The Baron was pre-occupied, for he had just published a little
      pamphlet, entitled: &ldquo;Do the Upper Classes constitute Society?&rdquo; They were
      sitting at breakfast in their cosy dining-room, and the doors which led to
      the nursery stood wide open. They listened to the nurse playing with the
      children, and the Baroness smiled with contentment and happiness. She had
      grown very gentle and her happiness was a quiet one. One of the children
      suddenly screamed and she rose from the table to see what was the matter.
      At the same moment the footman came into the dining-room with the morning
      post. The Baron opened two packets of printed matter. The first was a &ldquo;big
      respectable&rdquo; newspaper. He opened it and his eyes fell on a headline in
      fat type: &ldquo;A Blasphemer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to read: &ldquo;Christmas is upon us again! This festival dear to all
      pure hearts, this festival sacred to all Christian nations, which has
      brought a message of peace and good-will to all men, which makes even the
      murderer sheathe his knife, and the thief respect the sacred law of
      property; this festival, which is not only of very ancient origin, but
      which is also, especially in the countries of the North, surrounded by a
      host of historic associations, etc., etc. And then like foul fumes arising
      from a drain, an individual suddenly confronts us who does not scruple to
      tear asunder the most sacred bonds, who vomits malice on all respectable
      members of society; malice, dictated by the pettiest vengeance....&rdquo; He
      refolded the paper and put it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Then
      he opened the second parcel. It contained caricatures of himself and his
      wife. It went the same way as the first, but he had to be quick, for his
      wife was re-entering the dining-room. He finished his breakfast and went
      into his bed-room to get ready to go out. They left the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight fell on the frosted plane-trees of the Champs Elysées, and in
      the heart of the stony desert the Place de la Concorde opened out like a
      large oasis. He felt her arm on his, and yet he had the feeling as if she
      were supporting him. She talked of the presents which they were going to
      buy for the children, and he tried to force himself to take an interest in
      the subject. But all at once he interrupted her conversation and asked
      her, à-propos of nothing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the difference between vengeance and punishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never thought about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether it isn&rsquo;t this: When an anonymous journalist revenges
      himself, it is punishment; but when a well-known writer, who is not a
      pressman, fights with an open visor, meting out punishment, then it is
      revenge! Let us join the new prophets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She begged him not to spoil Christmas by talking of the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This festival,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;on which peace and good-will....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed through the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli, turned into the
      boulevards and made their purchases. They dined at the Grand Hotel. She
      was in a sunny frame of mind and tried to cheer him up. But he remained
      preoccupied. Suddenly he asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it possible that one can have a bad conscience when one has acted
      rightly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because the upper classes have so trained us, that our conscience
      troubles us whenever we rebel against them? Probably it is so. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t he who has been hurt unjustly, have the right to attack
      injustice? Because only he who has been hurt will attack, and the upper
      classes hate being attacked. Why did I not strike at the upper classes in
      the past, when I belonged to them? Because, of course, I didn&rsquo;t know them
      then. One must look at a picture from a distance in order to find the
      correct visual point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One shouldn&rsquo;t talk about such things on Christmas Eve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, it is Christmas. This festival of....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned home. They lit the candles on the Christmas tree; it
      radiated peace and happiness; but its dark branches smelt of a funeral and
      looked sinister, like the Baron&rsquo;s face. The nurse came in with the little
      ones. His face lighted up, for, he thought, when they are grown up they
      will reap in joy what we have sown in tears; then their conscience will
      only trouble them when they have sinned against the laws of nature; they
      won&rsquo;t have to suffer from whims which have been caned into us at school,
      drummed into us by the parsons, invented by the upper classes for their
      own benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness sat down at the piano when the maids and the footmen entered.
      She played melancholy old dances, dear to the heart of the people of the
      North, while the servants danced gravely with the children. It was very
      much like the penitential part of divine service.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the presents were distributed among the children, and the
      servants received their gifts. And then the children were put to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness went into the drawing-room and sat down in an arm-chair. The
      Baron threw himself on a footstool at her feet. He rested his head on her
      knees. It was so heavy&mdash;so heavy. She silently stroked his forehead.
      &ldquo;What! was he weeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never before seen a man weep. It was a terrible sight. His big
      strong frame shook, but he made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was he weeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not with her, but still, unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had anybody treated him badly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he tell her all about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he only wanted to sit at her knees, as he used to sit long ago, at
      his mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She talked to him as if he had been a child. She kissed his eyes and wiped
      his face with her handkerchief. She felt so proud, so strong, there were
      no tears in her eyes. The sight of her inspired him with new courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How weak he had been! That he should have found the machine-made attacks
      of his opponents so hard to bear! Did his enemies really believe what they
      said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible thought! Probably they did. One often found stones firmly grown
      into pine-trees, why should not opinions grow into the brain in the same
      way? But she believed in him, she knew that he was fighting for a good
      cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she believed it! But&mdash;he must not be angry with her for asking
      him such a question&mdash;but&mdash;did he not miss his child, the first
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, but it could not be helped. At least, not yet! But he and
      the others who were working for the future would have to find a remedy for
      that, too. He did not know, yet, what form that remedy would take, but
      stronger brains than his, and many together, would surely one day solve
      this problem which at present seemed insolvable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she hoped it would be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But their marriage? Was it a marriage in the true sense of the word,
      seeing that he couldn&rsquo;t tell her what troubled him? Wasn&rsquo;t it, too,
      pro...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was a true marriage, for they loved one another. There had been no
      love between him and his first wife. But he and she did love one another,
      could she deny it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t, he was her dear love.&rdquo; Then their marriage was a true
      marriage before God and before Nature.

    <h2>
      UNNATURAL SELECTION OR THE ORIGIN OF RACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Baron had read in <i>The Slaves of Life</i> with disgust and
      indignation that the children of the aristocracy were bound to perish
      unless they took the mothers&rsquo; milk from the children of the lower classes.
      He had read Darwin and believed that the gist of his teaching was that
      through selection the children of the aristocracy had come to be more
      highly developed representatives of the genus &ldquo;Man.&rdquo; But the doctrine of
      heredity made him look upon the employment of a foster-mother with
      aversion; for might not, with the blood of the lower classes, certain
      conceptions, ideas and desires be introduced and propagated in the
      aristocratic nursling? He was therefore determined that his wife should
      nurse her baby herself, and if she should prove incapable of doing so, the
      child should be brought up with the bottle. He had a right to the cows&rsquo; 
      milk, for they fed on his hay; without it they would starve, or would not
      have come into existence at all. The baby was born. It was a son! The
      father had been somewhat anxious before he became certain of his wife&rsquo;s
      condition, for he was, personally, a poor man; his wife, on the other
      hand, was very wealthy, but he had no claim to her fortune unless their
      union was blest with a legal heir, (in accordance with the law of entail
      chap. 00 par. 00). His joy was therefore great and genuine. The baby was a
      transparent little thoroughbred, with blue veins shining through his waxen
      skin. Nevertheless his blood was poor. His mother who possessed the figure
      of an angel, was brought up on choice food, protected by rich furs from
      all the eccentricities of the climate, and had that aristocratic pallor
      which denotes the woman of noble descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nursed the baby herself. There was consequently no need to become
      indebted to peasant women for the privilege of enjoying life on this
      planet. Nothing but fables, all he had read about it! The baby sucked and
      screamed for a fortnight. But all babies scream. It meant nothing. But it
      lost flesh. It became terribly emaciated. The doctor was sent for. He had
      a private conversation with the father, during which he declared that the
      baby would die if the Baroness continued to nurse him, because she was
      firstly too highly strung, and secondly had nothing with which to feed
      him. He took the trouble to make a quantitative analysis of the milk, and
      proved (by equations) that the child was bound to starve unless there was
      a change in the method of his feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done? On no account could the baby be allowed to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottle or foster mother? The latter was out of the question. Let us try
      the bottle! The doctor, however, prescribed a foster mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best Dutch cow, which had received the gold medal for the district,
      was isolated and fed with hay; with dry hay of the finest quality. The
      doctor analysed the milk, everything was all right. How simple the system
      was! How strange that they had not thought of it before! After all, one
      need not engage a foster mother a tyrant before whom one had to cringe, a
      loafer one had to fatten; not to mention the fact that she might have an
      infectious disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the baby continued to lose flesh and to scream. It screamed night and
      day. There was no doubt it suffered from colic. A new cow was procured and
      a fresh analysis made. The milk was mixed with Karlsbad water, genuine
      Sprudel, but the baby went on screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no remedy but to engage a foster mother,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! anything but that! One did not want to rob other children, it was
      against nature, and, moreover, what about heredity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Baron began to talk of things natural and unnatural, the doctor
      explained to him that if nature were allowed her own way, all noble
      families would die out and their estates fall to the crown. This was the
      wisdom of nature, and human civilization was nothing but a foolish
      struggle against nature, in which man was bound to be beaten. The Baron&rsquo;s
      race was doomed; this was proved by the fact that his wife was unable to
      feed the fruit of her womb; in order to live they were bound to buy or
      steal the milk of other women. Consequently the race lived on robbery,
      down to the smallest detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could the purchase of the milk be called robbery? The purchase of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because the money with which it was bought was produced by labour.
      Whose labour? The people&rsquo;s! For the aristocracy didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor was a socialist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a follower of Darwin. However, he didn&rsquo;t care in the least if they
      called him a socialist. It made no difference to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, purchase was not robbery! That was too strong a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but if one paid with money one hadn&rsquo;t earned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was to say, earned by manual labour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in that case the doctor was a robber too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so! Nevertheless he would not hold back with the truth! Didn&rsquo;t the
      Baron remember the repenting thief who had spoken such true words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was interrupted; the Baron sent for a famous professor.
      The latter called him a murderer straight out, because he had not engaged
      a nurse long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron had to persuade his wife. He had to retract all his former
      arguments and emphasize the one simple fact, namely, the love for his
      child, (regulated by the law of entail).
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was a foster mother to come from? It was no use thinking of
      looking for one in town, for there all people were corrupt. No, it would
      have to be a country girl. But the Baroness objected to a girl because,
      she argued, a girl with a baby was an immoral person; and her son might
      contract a hereditary tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor retorted that all foster mothers were unmarried women and that
      if the young Baron inherited from her a preference for the other sex, he
      would grow into a good fellow; tendencies of that sort ought to be
      encouraged. It was not likely that any of the farmers&rsquo; wives would accept
      the position, because a farmer who owned land, would certainly prefer to
      keep his wife and children with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing they married a girl to a farm labourer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would mean a delay of nine months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing they found a husband for a girl who had a baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron knew a girl who had a baby just three months old. He knew her
      only too well, for he had been engaged for three years and had been
      unfaithful to his fiancee by &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo; He went to her himself and
      made his suggestion. She should have a farm of her own if she would
      consent to marry Anders, a farm labourer, and come to the Manor as foster
      mother to the young Baron. Well, was it strange that she should accept the
      proffered settlement in preference to her bearing her disgrace alone? It
      was arranged there and then that on the following Sunday the banns should
      be read for the first, second and third time, and that Anders should go
      home to his own village for two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron looked at her baby with a strange feeling of envy. He was a big,
      strong boy. He was not beautiful, but he looked like a guarantee of many
      generations to come. The child was born to live but it was not his fate to
      fulfil his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna wept when he was taken to the orphanage, but the good food at the
      Manor (her dinner was sent up to her from the dining-room, and she had as
      much porter and wine as she wanted) consoled her. She was also allowed to
      go out driving in the big carriage, with a footman by the side of the
      coachman. And she read <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i>. Never in all her
      life had she been so well off.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an absence of two months Anders returned. He had done nothing but
      eat, drink, and rest. He took possession of the farm, but he also wanted
      his Anna. Couldn&rsquo;t she, at least, come and see him sometimes? No, the
      Baroness objected. No nonsense of that sort!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna lost flesh and the little Baron screamed. The doctor was consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go and see her husband,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing it did the baby harm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Anders must be &ldquo;analysed&rdquo; first. Anders objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anders received a present of a few sheep and was &ldquo;analysed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little Baron stopped screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now news came from the orphanage that Anna&rsquo;s boy had died of
      diphtheria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna fretted, and the little Baron screamed louder than ever. She was
      discharged and sent back to Anders and a new foster mother was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anders was glad to have his wife with him at last, but she had contracted
      expensive habits. She couldn&rsquo;t drink Brazilian coffee, for instance, it
      had to be Java. And her health did not permit her to eat fish six times a
      week, nor could she work in the fields. Food at the farm grew scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anders would have been obliged to give up the farm after twelve months,
      but the Baron had a kindly feeling for him and allowed him to stay on as a
      tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna worked daily at the Manor and frequently saw the little Baron; but he
      did not recognise her and it was just as well that he did not. And yet he
      had lain at her breast! And she had saved his life by sacrificing the life
      of her own child. But she was prolific and had several sons, who grew up
      and were labourers and railway men; one of them was a convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old Baron looked forward with anxiety to the day on which his son
      should marry and have children in his turn. He did not look strong! He
      would have been far more reassured if the other little Baron, the one who
      had died at the orphanage, had been the heir to the estates. And when he
      read <i>The Slaves of Life</i> a second time, he had to admit that the
      upper classes live at the mercy of the lower classes, and when he read
      Darwin again he could not deny that natural selection, in our time, was
      anything but natural. But facts were facts and remained unalterable, in
      spite of all the doctor and the socialists might say to the contrary.

    <h2>
      AN ATTEMPT AT REFORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had noticed with indignation that girls were solely brought up to be
      housekeepers for their future husbands. Therefore she had learnt a trade
      which would enable her to keep herself in all circumstances of life. She
      made artificial flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had noticed with regret that girls simply waited for a husband who
      should keep them; he resolved to marry a free and independent woman who
      could earn her own living; such a woman would be his equal and a companion
      for life, not a housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate ordained that they should meet. He was an artist and she, as I
      already mentioned, made flowers; they were both living in Paris at the
      time when they conceived these ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was style in their marriage. They took three rooms at Passy. In the
      centre was the studio, to the right of it his room, to the left hers. This
      did away with the common bed-room and double bed, that abomination which
      has no counterpart in nature and is responsible for a great deal of
      dissipation and immorality. It moreover did away with the inconvenience of
      having to dress and undress in the same room. It was far better that each
      of them should have a separate room and that the studio should be a
      neutral, common meeting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      They required no servant; they were going to do the cooking themselves and
      employ an old charwoman in the mornings and evenings. It was all very well
      thought out and excellent in theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing you had children?&rdquo; asked the sceptics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, there won&rsquo;t be any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It worked splendidly. He went to the market in the morning and did the
      catering. Then he made the coffee. She made the beds and put the rooms in
      order. And then they sat down and worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were tired of working they gossiped, gave one another good
      advice, laughed and were very jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock he lit the kitchen fire and she prepared the vegetables.
      He cooked the beef, while she ran across the street to the grocer&rsquo;s; then
      she laid the table and he dished up the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, they loved one another as husbands and wives do. They said
      good-night to each other and went into their own rooms, but there was no
      lock to keep him out when he knocked at her door; but the accommodation
      was small and the morning found them in their own quarters. Then he
      knocked at the wall:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, little girlie, how are you to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, darling, and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their meeting at breakfast was always like a new experience which never
      grew stale.
    </p>
    <p>
      They often went out together in the evening and frequently met their
      countrymen. She had no objection to the smell of tobacco, and was never in
      the way. Everybody said that it was an ideal marriage; no one had ever
      known a happier couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young wife&rsquo;s parents, who lived a long way off, were always
      writing and asking all sorts of indelicate questions; they were longing to
      have a grandchild. Louisa ought to remember that the institution of
      marriage existed for the benefit of the children, not the parents. Louisa
      held that this view was an old-fashioned one. Mama asked her whether she
      did not think that the result of the new ideas would be the complete
      extirpation of mankind? Louisa had never looked at it in that light, and
      moreover the question did not interest her. Both she and her husband were
      happy; at last the spectacle of a happy married couple was presented to
      the world, and the world was envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was very pleasant. Neither of them was master and they shared
      expenses. Now he earned more, now she did, but in the end their
      contributions to the common fund amounted to the same figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had a birthday! She was awakened in the morning by the entrance
      of the charwoman with a bunch of flowers and a letter painted all over
      with flowers, and containing the following words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To the lady flower-bud from her dauber, who wishes her many happy
  returns of the day and begs her to honour him with her company at an
  excellent little breakfast&mdash;at once.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She knocked at his door&mdash;come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      And they breakfasted, sitting on the bed&mdash;his bed; and the charwoman
      was kept the whole day to do all the work. It was a lovely birthday!
    </p>
    <p>
      Their happiness never palled. It lasted two years. All the prophets had
      prophesied falsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a model marriage!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when two years had passed, the young wife fell ill. She put it down to
      some poison contained in the wall-paper; he suggested germs of some sort.
      Yes, certainly, germs. But something was wrong. Something was not as it
      should be. She must have caught cold. Then she grew stout. Was she
      suffering from tumour? Yes, they were afraid she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She consulted a doctor&mdash;and came home crying. It was indeed a growth,
      but one which would one day see daylight, grow into a flower and bear
      fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband did anything but cry. He found style in it, and then the
      wretch went to his club and boasted about it to his friends. But the wife
      still wept. What would her position be now? She would soon not be able to
      earn money with her work and then she would have to live on him. And they
      would have to have a servant! Ugh! those servants!
    </p>
    <p>
      All their care, their caution, their wariness had been wrecked on the rock
      of the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mother-in-law wrote enthusiastic letters and repeated over and
      over again that marriage was instituted by God for the protection of the
      children; the parents&rsquo; pleasure counted for very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugo implored her to forget the fact that she would not be able to earn
      anything in future. Didn&rsquo;t she do her full share of the work by mothering
      the baby? Wasn&rsquo;t that as good as money? Money was, rightly understood,
      nothing but work. Therefore she paid her share in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took her a long time to get over the fact that he had to keep her. But
      when the baby came, she forgot all about it. She remained his wife and
      companion as before in addition to being the mother of his child, and he
      found that this was worth more than anything else.

    <h2>
      A NATURAL OBSTACLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her father had insisted on her learning book-keeping, so that she might
      escape the common lot of young womanhood; to sit there and wait for a
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now employed as book-keeper in the goods department of the
      Railways, and was universally looked upon as a very capable young woman.
      She had a way of getting on with people, and her prospects were excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she met the green forester from the School of Forestry and married
      him. They had made up their minds not to have any children; theirs was to
      be a true, spiritual marriage, and the world was to be made to realise
      that a woman, too, has a soul, and is not merely sex. Husband and wife met
      at dinner in the evening. It really was a true marriage, the union of two
      souls; it was, of course, also the union of two bodies, but this is a
      point one does not discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the wife came home and told her husband that her office hours had
      been changed. The directors had decided to run a new night train to Malmo,
      and in future she would have to be at her office from six to nine in the
      evening. It was a nuisance, for he could not come home before six. That
      was quite impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth they had to dine separately and meet only at night. He was
      dissatisfied. He hated the long evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell into the habit of calling for her. But he found it dull to sit on
      a chair in the goods department and have the porters knocking against him.
      He was always in the way. And when he tried to talk to her as she sat at
      her desk with the penholder behind her ear, she interrupted him with a
      curt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do be quiet until I&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the porters turned away their faces and he could see by their backs
      that they were laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes one or the other of her colleagues announced him with a:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband is waiting for you, Mrs. X.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo; There was something scornful in the very way in which they
      pronounced the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what irritated him more than anything else was the fact that the desk
      nearest to her was occupied by a &ldquo;young ass&rdquo; who was always gazing into
      her eyes and everlastingly consulting the ledger, bending over her
      shoulders so that he almost touched her with his chin. And they talked of
      invoices and certificates, of things which might have meant anything for
      all he knew. And they compared papers and figures and seemed to be on more
      familiar terms with one another than husband and wife were. And that was
      quite natural, for she saw more of the young ass than of her husband. It
      struck him that their marriage was not a true spiritual marriage after
      all; in order to be that he, too, would have had to be employed in the
      goods department. But as it happened he was at the School of Forestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, or rather one night, she told him that on the following Saturday
      a meeting of railway employés, which was to conclude with a dinner, would
      be held, and that she would have to be present. Her husband received the
      communication with a little air of constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to go?&rdquo; he asked naïvely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be the only woman amongst so many men, and when men have had
      too much to drink, they are apt to become coarse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you attend the meetings of the School of Forestry without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, but I am not the only man amongst a lot of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men and women were equals, she was amazed that he, who had always
      preached the emancipation of women could have any objection to her
      attending the meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admitted that it was nothing but prejudice on his part. He admitted
      that she was right and that he was wrong, but all the same he begged her
      not to go; he hated the idea. He couldn&rsquo;t get over the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was inconsequent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admitted that he was inconsequent, but it would take ten generations
      to get used to the new conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must not go to meetings either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was quite a different matter, for his meetings were attended by men
      only. He didn&rsquo;t mind her going out without him; what he didn&rsquo;t like was
      that she went out alone with so many men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t be alone, for the cashier&rsquo;s wife would be present as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the cashier&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then couldn&rsquo;t he be present as her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he want to make himself so cheap by being in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mind making himself cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Why not? He was afraid that something might come between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame to be jealous! What an insult! What distrust! What did he
      think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she was perfect. He would prove it. She could go alone!&rdquo; &ldquo;Could she
      really? How condescending of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went. She did not come home until the early hours of the morning. She
      awakened her husband and told him how well it had all gone off. He was
      delighted to hear it. Somebody had made a speech about her; they had sung
      quartets and ended with a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how had she come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young ass had accompanied her to the front door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing anybody who knew them had seen her at three o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning in the company of the young ass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what then? She was a respectable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she might easily lose her reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! He was jealous, and what was even worse, he was envious. He grudged
      her every little bit of fun. That was what being married meant! To be
      scolded if one dared to go out and enjoy oneself a little. What a stupid
      institution marriage was! But was their union a true marriage? They met
      one another at night, just as other married couples did. Men were all
      alike. Civil enough until they were married, but afterwards, oh!
      Afterwards.... Her husband was no better than other men: he looked upon
      her as his property, he thought he had a right to order her about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true. There was a time when he had believed that they belonged to
      one another, but he had made a mistake. He belonged to her as a dog
      belonged to its master. What was he but her footman, who called for her at
      night to see her home? He was &lsquo;her husband.&rsquo; But did she want to be &lsquo;his
      wife&rsquo;? Were they equals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t come home to quarrel with him. She wanted to be nothing but
      his wife, and she did not want him to be anything but her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the champagne, he thought, and turned to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried and begged him not to be unjust, but to&mdash;forgive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the blankets over his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him again if he&mdash;if he didn&rsquo;t want her to be his wife any
      more?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, he wanted her! But he had been so dreadfully bored all
      the evening, he could never live through another evening like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them forget all about it then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they forgot all about it and continued loving one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following evening, when the green forester came for his wife, he
      was told that she had gone to the store rooms. He was alone in the
      counting-house and sat down on a chair. Presently a glass door was opened
      and the young ass put in his head: &ldquo;Are you here, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, it was only her husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went away. The young ass called his wife Annie, and was
      evidently on very familiar terms with her. It was more than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came home they had a scene. She reproached him with the fact that
      he did not take his views on the emancipation of women seriously,
      otherwise he could not be annoyed at her being on familiar terms with her
      fellow-clerks. He made matters worse by admitting that his views were not
      to be taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he didn&rsquo;t mean what he was saying! Had he changed his mind? How
      could he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he had changed his mind. One could not help modifying one&rsquo;s views
      almost daily, because one had to adapt them to the conditions of life
      which were always changing. And if he had believed in spiritual marriages
      in the days gone by, he had now come to lose faith in marriages of any
      sort whatever. That was progress in the direction of radicalism. And as to
      the spiritual, she was spiritually married to the young ass rather than to
      him, for they exchanged views on the management of the goods department
      daily and hourly, while she took no interest at all in the cultivation of
      forests. Was there anything spiritual in their marriage? Was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not any longer! Her love was dead! He had killed it when he renounced
      his splendid faith in&mdash;the emancipation of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters became more and more unbearable. The green forester began to look
      to his fellow-foresters for companionship and gave up thinking of the
      goods department and its way of conducting business, matters which he
      never understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; she kept on saying over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t understand the goods department,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, or rather one morning, he told her that he was going botanising
      with a girls&rsquo; class. He was teaching botany in a girls&rsquo; school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! indeed! Why had he never mentioned it before? Big girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very big ones. From sixteen to twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! In the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! In the afternoon! And they would have supper in one of the outlying
      little villages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would they? The head-mistress would be there of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, she had every confidence in him, since he was a married man. It
      was an advantage, sometimes, to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the next day she was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to leave her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must consider his work before anything else. Was she very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! terribly ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her objections he sent for a doctor. The doctor declared that
      there was nothing much the matter; it was quite unnecessary for the
      husband to stay at home. The green forester returned towards morning. He
      was in high spirits. He had enjoyed himself immensely! He had not had such
      a day for a long, long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm burst. Huhuhu! This struggle was too much for her! He must swear
      a solemn oath never to love any woman but her. Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had convulsions; he ran for the smelling salts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too generous to give her details of the supper with the
      schoolgirls, but he could not forego the pleasure of mentioning his former
      simile anent dogs and possession, and he took the occasion to draw her
      attention to the fact that love without the conception of a right to
      possession&mdash;on both sides&mdash;was not thinkable. What was making
      her cry? The same thing which had made him swear, when she went out with
      twenty men. The fear of losing him! But one can lose only that which one
      possesses! Possesses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the rent was repaired. But goods department and girls&rsquo; school were
      ready with their scissors to undo the laborious mending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harmony was disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife fell ill. She was sure that she had hurt herself in lifting a
      case which was too heavy for her. She was so keen on her work that she
      could not bear to wait while the porters stood about and did nothing. She
      was compelled to lend a hand. Now she must have ruptured herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed, there was something the matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      How angry she was! Angry with her husband who alone was to blame. What
      were they going to do with the baby? It would have to be boarded out!
      Rousseau had done that. It was true, he was a fool, but on this particular
      point he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was full of fads and fancies. The forester had to resign his lessons
      at the girls&rsquo; school at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chafed and fretted because she was no longer able to go into the store
      rooms, but compelled to stay in the counting-house all day long and make
      entries. But the worst blow which befell her was the arrival of an
      assistant whose secret mission it was to take her place when she would be
      laid up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of her colleagues had changed, too. The porters grinned. She
      felt ashamed and longed to hide herself. It would be better to stay at
      home and cook her husband&rsquo;s dinner than sit here and be stared at. Oh!
      What black chasms of prejudice lay concealed in the deceitful hearts of
      men!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stayed at home for the last month, for the walk to and from her office
      four times a day was too much for her. And she was always so hungry! She
      had to send out for sandwiches in the morning. And every now and then she
      felt faint and had to take a rest. What a life! A woman&rsquo;s lot was indeed a
      miserable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we board it out?&rdquo; asked the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he no heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, of course he had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the baby remained at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a very polite letter arrived from the head office, enquiring after
      the young mother&rsquo;s health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very well and would be back at the office on the day after
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still a little weak and had to take a cab; but she soon picked up
      her strength. However, a new difficulty now presented itself. She must be
      kept informed of the baby&rsquo;s condition; a messenger boy was despatched to
      her home, at first twice a day, then every two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she was told that the baby had been crying, she put on her hat
      and rushed home at once. But the assistant was there, ready to take her
      place. The head clerk was very civil and made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the young mother discovered accidentally that the nurse was unable
      to feed the baby, but had concealed the fact for fear of losing her place.
      She had to take a day off in order to find a new foster mother. But they
      were all alike; brutal egoists every one of them, who took no interest in
      the children of strangers. No one could ever depend on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed the husband, &ldquo;in a case of this sort one can only depend on
      oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate that I ought to give up my work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You must do as you like about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And become your slave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean that at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little one was not at all well; all children are ill occasionally. He
      was teething! One day&rsquo;s leave after another! The poor baby suffered from
      toothache. She had to soothe him at night, work at the office during the
      day, sleepy, tired, anxious, and again take a day off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green forester did his best and carried the baby about in his arms
      half the night, but he never said a word about his wife&rsquo;s work at the
      goods department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she knew what was in his mind. He was waiting for her to give
      in; but he was deceitful and so he said nothing! How treacherous men were!
      She hated him; she would sooner kill herself than throw up her work and
      &ldquo;be his slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The forester saw quite clearly now that it was impossible for any woman to
      emancipate herself from the laws of nature; <i>under present circumstances</i>,
      he was shrewd enough to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the baby was five months old, it was plainly evident that the whole
      thing would before very long repeat itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a catastrophe!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when that sort of thing once begins....
    </p>
    <p>
      The forester was obliged to resume his lessons at the girls&rsquo; school to
      augment their income, and now&mdash;she laid down her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your slave, now,&rdquo; she groaned, when she came home with her
      discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she is the head of the house, and he gives her every penny he
      earns. When he wants to buy a cigar he makes a long speech before he
      ventures to ask for the money. She never refuses it to him, but all the
      same he finds the asking for it unpleasant. He is allowed to attend
      meetings, but no dinners, and all botanising with girls is strictly
      forbidden. He does not miss it much, for he prefers playing with his
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      His colleagues call him henpecked; but he smiles, and tells them that he
      is happy in spite of it, because he has in his wife a very sweet and
      sensible companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, on her part, obstinately maintains that she is nothing but his slave,
      whatever he might say to the contrary. It is her one comfort, poor, little
      woman!

    <h2>
      A DOLL&rsquo;S HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had been married for six years, but they were still more like lovers
      than husband and wife. He was a captain in the navy, and every summer he
      was obliged to leave her for a few months; twice he had been away on a
      long voyage. But his short absences were a blessing in disguise, for if
      their relations had grown a little stale during the winter, the summer
      trip invariably restored them to their former freshness and
      delightfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first summer he wrote veritable love-letters to her and never
      passed a sailing ship without signalling: &ldquo;Will you take letters?&rdquo; And
      when he came in sight of the landmarks of the Stockholm Archipelago, he
      did not know how to get to her quickly enough. But she found a way. She
      wired him to Landsort that she would meet him at Dalarö. When he anchored,
      he saw a little blue scarf fluttering on the verandah of the hotel: then
      he knew that it was she. But there was so much to do aboard that it was
      evening before he could go ashore. He saw her from his gig on the
      landing-stage as the bow held out his oar to fend off; she was every bit
      as young, as pretty and as strong as she had been when he left her; it was
      exactly as if they were re-living the first spring days of their love. A
      delicious little supper waited for him in the two little rooms she had
      engaged. What a lot they had to talk about! The voyage, the children, the
      future! The wine sparkled in the glasses and his kisses brought the blood
      to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tattoo went on the ship, but he took no notice of it, for he did not
      intend to leave her before one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? He was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he must get back aboard, but it would do if he was there for the
      morning watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did the morning watch begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!... As early as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where was she going to stay the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was her business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He guessed it and wanted to have a look at her room; but she planted
      herself firmly on the threshold. He covered her face with kisses, took her
      in his arms as if she were a baby and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an enormous bed! It was like the long boat. Where did the people get
      it from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, she had understood from his letter that they would stay at the
      hotel together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so they would, in spite of his having to be back aboard for the
      morning watch. What did he care for the stupid morning prayers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he say such a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t they better have some coffee and a fire? The sheets felt damp!
      What a sensible little rogue she was to provide for his staying, too! Who
      would have thought that she had so much sense? Where did she get it from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t get it from anywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well, he might have known! He might have known everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But he was so stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, he was stupid, was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he slipped his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he ought to behave himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave himself? It was easy to talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl was coming with the wood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it struck two, and sea and Skerries were flaming in the east, they
      were sitting at the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were lovers still, weren&rsquo;t they? And now he must go. But he would be
      back at ten, for breakfast, and after that they would go for a sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made some coffee on her spirit lamp, and they drank it while the sun
      was rising and the seagulls screamed. The gunboat was lying far out at sea
      and every now and then he saw the cutlasses of the watch glinting in the
      sunlight. It was hard to part, but the certainty of meeting again in a few
      hours&rsquo; time helped them to bear it. He kissed her for the last time,
      buckled on his sword and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the bridge and shouted: &ldquo;boat ahoy!&rdquo; she hid herself
      behind the window curtains as if she were ashamed to be seen. He blew
      kisses to her until the sailors came with the gig. Then a last: &ldquo;Sleep
      well and dream of me&rdquo; and the gig put off. He watched her through his
      glasses, and for a long time he could distinguish a little figure with
      black hair. The sunbeams fell on her nightdress and bare throat and made
      her look like a mermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reveille went. The longdrawn bugle notes rolled out between the green
      islands over the shining water and returned from behind the pine woods.
      The whole crew assembled on deck and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and &ldquo;Jesus, at the
      day&rsquo;s beginning&rdquo; were read. The little church tower of Dalarö answered
      with a faint ringing of bells, for it was Sunday. Cutters came up in the
      morning breeze: flags were flying, shots resounded, light summer dresses
      gleamed on the bridge, the steamer, leaving a crimson track behind her,
      steamed up, the fishers hauled in their nets, and the sun shone on the
      blue, billowy water and the green islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock six pairs rowed the gig ashore from the gunboat. They were
      together again. And as they sat at breakfast in the large dining-room, the
      hotel guests watched and whispered: &ldquo;Is she his wife?&rdquo; He talked to her in
      an undertone like a lover, and she cast down her eyes and smiled; or hit
      his fingers with her dinner napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat lay alongside the bridge; she sat at the helm, he looked after
      the foresail. But he could not take his eyes off her finely shaped figure
      in the light summer dress, her determined little face and proud eyes, as
      she sat looking to windward, while her little hand in its strong leather
      glove held the mainsheet. He wanted to talk to her and was purposely
      clumsy in tacking; then she scolded him as if he were a cabin boy, which
      amused him immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring the baby with you?&rdquo; he asked her teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where should I have put it to sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the long boat, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him in a way which filled his heart with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did the proprietress say this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she sleep well last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she sleep well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; she might have been kept awake by rats, or perhaps by the
      rattling of a window; who can tell what might not disturb the gentle sleep
      of an old maid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop talking nonsense, I shall make the sheet fast and sail
      you to the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They landed at a small island and ate their luncheon which they had
      brought with them in a little basket. After lunch they shot at a target
      with a revolver. Then they pretended to fish with rods, but they caught
      nothing and sailed out again into the open sea where the eidergeese were,
      through a strait where they watched the carp playing about the rushes. He
      never tired of looking at her, talking to her, kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner they met for six summers, and always they were just as
      young, just as mad and just as happy as before. They spent the winter in
      Stockholm in their little cabins. He amused himself by rigging boats for
      his little boys or telling them stories of his adventures in China and the
      South Sea Islands, while his wife sat by him, listening and laughing at
      his funny tales. It was a charming room, that could not be equalled in the
      whole world. It was crammed full of Japanese sunshades and armour,
      miniature pagodas from India, bows and lances from Australia, nigger drums
      and dried flying fish, sugar cane and opium pipes. Papa, whose hair was
      growing thin at the top, did not feel very happy outside his own four
      walls. Occasionally he played at draughts with his friend, the auditor,
      and sometimes they had a game at Boston and drank a glass of grog. At
      first his wife had joined in the game, but now that she had four children,
      she was too busy; nevertheless, she liked to sit with the players for a
      little and look at their cards, and whenever she passed Papa&rsquo;s chair he
      caught her round the waist and asked her whether she thought he ought to
      be pleased with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the corvette was to be away for six months. The captain did not
      feel easy about it, for the children were growing up and the
      responsibility of the big establishment was too much for Mama. The captain
      himself was not quite so young and vigorous as he had been, but&mdash;it
      could not be helped and so he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly he arrived at Kronborg he posted a letter to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My darling Topmast,&rdquo; it began.

  &ldquo;Wind moderate, S.S.E. by E. + 10° C. 6 bells, watch below. I cannot
  express in words what I feel on this voyage during which I shall not
  see you. When we kedged out (at 6 p.m. while a strong gale blew from
  N.E. by N.) I felt as if a belaying pin were suddenly being driven
  into my chest and I actually had a sensation as if a chain had been
  drawn through the hawsepipes of my ears. They say that sailors can
  feel the approach of misfortune. I don&rsquo;t know whether this is true,
  but I shall not feel easy until I have had a letter from you. Nothing
  has happened on board, simply because nothing must happen. How are you
  all at home? Has Bob had his new boots, and do they fit? I am a
  wretched correspondent as you know, so 111 stop now. With a big kiss
  right on this x.

  &ldquo;Your old Pal.

  &ldquo;P.S. You ought to find a friend (female, of course) and don&rsquo;t forget
  to ask the proprietress at Dalaro to take care of the long boat until
  my return. The wind is getting up; it will blow from the North to-night.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Off Portsmouth the captain received the following letter from his wife:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Dear old Pal,

  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible here without you, believe me. I have had a lot of
  worry, too, for little Alice has got a new tooth. The doctor said it
  was unusually early, which was a sign of (but I&rsquo;m not going to tell
  you that). Bob&rsquo;s boots fit him very well and he is very proud of them.

  &ldquo;You say in your letter that I ought to find a friend of my own sex.
  Well, I have found one, or, rather, she has found me. Her name is
  Ottilia Sandegren, and she was educated at the seminary. She is rather
  grave and takes life very seriously, therefore you need not be afraid,
  Pal, that your Topmast will be led astray. Moreover, she is religious.
  We really ought to take religion a little more seriously, both of us.
  She is a splendid woman. She has just arrived and sends you her kind
  regards.

  &ldquo;Your Gurli.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The captain was not overpleased with this letter. It was too short and not
      half as bright as her letters generally were. Seminary, religion, grave,
      Ottilia: Ottilia twice! And then Gurli! Why not Gulla as before? H&rsquo;m!
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he received a second letter from Bordeaux, a letter which was
      accompanied by a book, sent under separate cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear William!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! William! No longer Pal!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Life is a
      struggle&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What the deuce does she mean? What has that to do with
      us?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;from beginning to end. Gently as a river in Kedron&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Kedron!
      she&rsquo;s quoting the Bible!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;our life has glided along. Like
      sleepwalkers we have been walking on the edge of precipices without being
      aware of them&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The seminary, oh! the seminary!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Suddenly we
      find ourselves face to face with the ethical&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The ethical?
      Ablative!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;asserting itself in its higher potencies!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Potencies?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      that I am awake from my long sleep and ask myself: has our marriage been a
      marriage in the true sense of the word? I must admit with shame and
      remorse that this has not been the case. For love is of divine origin.
      (St. Matthew xi. 22, 24.)&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain had to mix himself a glass of rum and water before he felt
      able to continue his reading.&mdash;&ldquo;How earthly, how material our love
      has been! Have our souls lived in that harmony of which Plato speaks?
      (Phaidon, Book vi. Chap. ii. Par. 9). Our answer is bound to be in the
      negative. What have I been to you? A housekeeper and, oh! The disgrace!
      your mistress! Have our souls understood one another? Again we are bound
      to answer &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To Hell with all Ottilias and seminaries! Has she
      been my housekeeper? She has been my wife and the mother of my children!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Read
      the book I have sent you! It will answer all your questions. It voices
      that which for centuries has lain hidden in the hearts of all women! Read
      it, and then tell me if you think that our union has been a true marriage.
      Your Gurli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His presentiment of evil had not deceived him. The captain was beside
      himself; he could not understand what had happened to his wife. It was
      worse than religious hypocrisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore off the wrapper and read on the title page of a book in a paper
      cover: <i>Et Dukkehjem af Henrik Ibsen</i>. A Doll&rsquo;s House? Well, and&mdash;?
      His home had been a charming doll&rsquo;s house; his wife had been his little
      doll and he had been her big doll. They had danced along the stony path of
      life and had been happy. What more did they want? What was wrong? He must
      read the book at once and find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished it in three hours. His brain reeled. How did it concern him
      and his wife? Had they forged bills? No! Hadn&rsquo;t they loved one another? Of
      course they had!
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked himself into his cabin and read the book a second time; he
      underlined passages in red and blue, and when the dawn broke, he took &ldquo;A
      well-meant little ablative on the play <i>A Doll&rsquo;s House</i>, written by
      the old Pal on board the Vanadis in the Atlantic off Bordeaux. (Lat. 45°
      Long. 16°.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;1. She married him because he was in love with her and that was a
  deuced clever thing to do. For if she had waited until she had fallen
  in love with someone, it might have happened that <i>he</i> would not have
  fallen in love with her, and then there would have been the devil to
  pay. For it happens very rarely that both parties are equally in love.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;2. She forges a bill. That was foolish, but it is not true that it
  was done for the husband&rsquo;s sake only, for she has never loved him; it
  would have been the truth if she had said that she had done it for him,
  herself and the children. Is that clear?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;3. That he wants to embrace her after the ball is only a proof of his
  love for her, and there is no wrong in that; but it should not be done
  on the stage. &ldquo;<i>Il y a des choses qui se font mais que ne se disent
  point</i>,&rsquo; as the French say, Moreover, if the poet had been fair, he
  would also save shown an opposite case. &lsquo;<i>La petite chienne veut, mais
  le grand chien ne veut pas</i>,&rsquo; says Ollendorf. (Vide the long boat at
  Dalarö.)&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;4. That she, when she discovers that her husband is a fool (and that
  he is when he offers to condone her offence because it has not leaked
  out) decides to leave her children &lsquo;not considering herself worthy of
  bringing them up,&rsquo; is a not very clever trick of coquetry. If they have
  both been fools (and surely they don&rsquo;t teach at the seminary that it
  is right to forge bills) they should pull well together in future in
  double harness.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Least of all is she justified in leaving her children&rsquo;s education in
  the hands of the father whom she despises.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;5. Nora has consequently every reason for staying with her children
  when she discovers what an imbecile her husband is.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;6. The husband cannot be blamed for not sufficiently appreciating
  her, for she doesn&rsquo;t reveal her true character until after the row.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;7. Nora has undoubtedly been a fool; she herself does not deny it.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;8. There is every guarantee of their pulling together more happily
  in future; he has repented and promised to turn over a new leaf. So
  has she. Very well! Here&rsquo;s my hand, let&rsquo;s begin again at the beginning.
  Birds of a feather flock together. There&rsquo;s nothing lost, we&rsquo;ve both
  been fools! You, little Nora, were badly brought up. I, old rascal,
  didn&rsquo;t know any better. We are both to be pitied. Pelt our teachers
  with rotten eggs, but don&rsquo;t hit me alone on the head. I, though a man,
  am every bit as innocent as you are! Perhaps even a little more so,
  for I married for love, you for a home. Let us be friends, therefore,
  and together teach our children the valuable lesson we have learnt
  in the school of life.&rdquo;
 
  Is that clear? All right then!

  This was written by Captain Pal with his stiff fingers and slow brain!

  And now, my darling dolly, I have read your book and given you my
  opinion. But what have we to do with it? Didn&rsquo;t we love one another?
  Haven&rsquo;t we educated one another and helped one another to rub off our
  sharp corners? Surely you&rsquo;ll remember that we had many a little
  encounter in the beginning! What fads of yours are those? To hell with
  all Ottilias and seminaries!

  The book you sent me is a queer book. It is like a watercourse with
  an insufficient number of buoys, so that one might run aground at any
  moment. But I pricked the chart and found calm waters. Only, I
  couldn&rsquo;t do it again. The devil may crack these nuts which are rotten
  inside when one has managed to break the shell. I wish you peace and
  happiness and the recovery of your sound common sense.

  &ldquo;How are the little ones? You forgot to mention them. Probably you
  were thinking too much of Nora&rsquo;s unfortunate kiddies, (which exist
  only in a play of that sort). Is my little boy crying? My nightingale
  singing, my dolly dancing? She must always do that if she wants to
  make her old pal happy. And now may God bless you and prevent evil
  thoughts from rising between us. My heart is sadder than I can tell.
  And I am expected to sit down and write a critique on a play. God
  bless you and the babies; kiss their rosy cheeks for your faithful
  old Pal.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When the captain had sent off his letter, he went into the officers&rsquo; mess
      and drank a glass of punch. The doctor was there, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed a smell of old black breeches?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I should like
      to hoist myself up to the cat block and let a good old N.W. by N. blow
      right through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor did not understand what he was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ottilia, Ottilia!... What she wants is a taste of the handspike. Send the
      witch to the quarterdeck and let the second mess loose on her behind
      closed hatches. One knows what is good for an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, old chap?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plato! Plato! To the devil with Plato! To be six months at sea makes one
      sick of Plato. That teaches one ethics! Ethics? I bet a marlinspike to a
      large rifle: if Ottilia were married she would cease talking of Plato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Do you hear? You&rsquo;re a doctor. What&rsquo;s the matter with those
      women? Isn&rsquo;t it bad for them to remain unmarried? Doesn&rsquo;t it make them...?
      What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave him his candid opinion and added that he was sorry that
      there were not enough men to go round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a state of nature the male is mostly polygamous; in most cases there
      is no obstacle to this, as there is plenty of food for the young ones
      (beasts of prey excepted): abnormalities like unmated females do not exist
      in nature. But in civilised countries, where a man is lucky if he earns
      enough bread, it is a common occurrence, especially as the females are in
      preponderance. One ought to treat unmarried women with kindness, for their
      lot is a melancholy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With kindness! That&rsquo;s all very well; but supposing they are anything but
      kind themselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he told the doctor the whole story, even confessing that he had
      written a critique on a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, no end of nonsense is written,&rdquo; said the doctor, putting his
      hand on the lid of the jug which contained the punch. &ldquo;In the end science
      decides all great questions! Science, and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the six months were over and the captain, who had been in constant,
      but not very pleasant, correspondence with his wife, (she had sharply
      criticised his critique), at last landed at Dalarö, he was received by his
      wife, all the children, two servants and Ottilia. His wife was
      affectionate, but not cordial. She held up her brow to be kissed. Ottilia
      was as tall as a stay, and wore her hair short; seen from the back she
      looked like a swab. The supper was dull and they drank only tea. The long
      boat took in a cargo of children and the captain was lodged in one of the
      attics.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a change! Poor old Pal looked old and felt puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be married and yet not have a wife,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s intolerable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he wanted to take his wife for a sail. But the
      sea did not agree with Ottilia. She had been ill on the steamer. And,
      moreover, it was Sunday. Sunday? That was it! Well, they would go for a
      walk. They had a lot to talk about. Of course, they had a lot to say to
      each other. But Ottilia was not to come with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out together, arm in arm. But they did not talk much; and what
      they said were words uttered for the sake of concealing their thoughts
      more than for the sake of exchanging ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the little cholera cemetery and took the road leading to the
      Swiss Valley. A faint breeze rustled through the pine trees and glimpses
      of the blue sea flashed through the dark branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on a stone. He threw himself on the turf at her feet. Now
      the storm is going to burst, he thought, and it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought at all about our marriage?&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with every appearance of having fully considered the
      matter, &ldquo;I have merely felt about it. In my opinion love is a matter of
      sentiment; one steers by landmarks and makes port; take compass and chart
      and you are sure to founder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but our home has been nothing but a doll&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but this is not quite true. You have never forged a bill; you
      have never shown your ankles to a syphilitic doctor of whom you wanted to
      borrow money against security <i>in natura</i>; you have never been so
      romantically silly as to expect your husband to give himself up for a
      crime which his wife had committed from ignorance, and which was not a
      crime because there was no plaintiff; and you have never lied to me. I
      have treated you every bit as honestly as Helmer treated his wife when he
      took her into his full confidence and allowed her to have a voice in the
      banking business; tolerated her interference with the appointment of an
      employee. We have therefore been husband and wife according to all
      conceptions, old and new-fashioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I have been your housekeeper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, you are wrong. You have never had a meal in the kitchen, you
      have never received wages, you have never had to account for money spent.
      I have never scolded you because one thing or the other was not to my
      liking. And do you consider my work: to reckon and to brace, to ease off
      and call out &lsquo;Present arms,&rsquo; count herrings and measure rum, weigh peas
      and examine flour, more honourable than yours: to look after the servants,
      cater for the house and bring up the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you are paid for your work! You are your own master! You are a
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, do you want me to give you wages? Do you want to be my
      housekeeper in real earnest? That I was born a man is an accident. I might
      almost say a pity, for it&rsquo;s very nearly a crime to be a man now-a-days,
      but it isn&rsquo;t my fault. The devil take him who has stirred up the two
      halves of humanity, one against the other! He has much to answer for. Am I
      the master? Don&rsquo;t we both rule? Have I ever decided any important matter
      without asking for your advice? What? But you&mdash;you bring up the
      children exactly as you like! Don&rsquo;t you remember that I wanted you to stop
      rocking them to sleep because I said it produced a sort of intoxication?
      But you had your own way! Another time I had mine, and then it was your
      turn again. There was no compromise possible, because there was no middle
      course to steer between rocking and not rocking. We got on very well until
      now. But you have thrown me over for Ottilia&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ottilia! always Ottilia! Didn&rsquo;t you yourself send her to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not her personally! But there can be no doubt that it is she who
      rules now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to separate me from all I care for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Ottilia all you care for? It almost looks like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t send her away now that I have engaged her to teach the girls
      pedagogics and Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latin! Great Scott! Are the girls to be ruined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are to know everything a man knows, so that when the time comes,
      their marriage will be a true marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my love, all husbands don&rsquo;t know Latin! I don&rsquo;t know more than one
      single word, and that is &lsquo;ablative.&rsquo; And we have been happy in spite of
      it. Moreover, there is a movement to strike off Latin from the plan of
      instruction for boys, as a superfluous accomplishment. Doesn&rsquo;t this teach
      you a lot? Isn&rsquo;t it enough that the men are ruined, are the women to be
      ruined, too? Ottilia, Ottilia, what have I done to you, that you should
      treat me like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing we dropped that matter.&mdash;Our love, William, has not been
      what it should be. It has been sensual!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my darling, how could we have had children, if it hadn&rsquo;t? And it has
      not been sensual only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can a thing be both black and white? Tell me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it can. There&rsquo;s your sunshade for instance, it is black
      outside and white inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, sweetheart, tell me in your own way the thoughts which are
      in your heart; don&rsquo;t talk like Ottilia&rsquo;s books. Don&rsquo;t let your head run
      away with you; be yourself again, my sweet, darling little wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, your property, bought with your labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I am your property, your husband, at whom no other woman is
      allowed to look if she wants to keep her eyes in her head; your husband,
      who made a present of himself to you, or rather, gave himself to you in
      exchange. Are we not quits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have trifled away our lives! Have we ever had any higher
      interests, William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the very highest, Gurli; we have not always been playing, we have
      had grave hours, too. Have we not called into being generations to come?
      Have we not both bravely worked and striven for the little ones, who are
      to grow up into men and women? Have you not faced death four times for
      their sakes? Have you not robbed yourself of your nights&rsquo; rest in order to
      rock their cradle, and of your days&rsquo; pleasures, in order to attend to
      them? Couldn&rsquo;t we now have a large six-roomed flat in the main street, and
      a footman to open the door, if it were not for the children? Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      be able to wear silk dresses and pearls? And I, your old Pal, wouldn&rsquo;t
      have <i>crows&rsquo; nests</i> in my knees, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the kiddies.
      Are we really no better than dolls? Are we as selfish as old maids say?
      Old maids, rejected by men as no good. Why are so many girls unmarried?
      They all boast of proposals and yet they pose as martyrs! Higher
      interests! Latin! To dress in low neck dresses for charitable purposes and
      leave the children at home, neglected! I believe that my interests are
      higher than Ottilia&rsquo;s, when I want strong and healthy children, who will
      succeed where we have failed. But Latin won&rsquo;t help them! Goodbye, Gurli! I
      have to go back on board. Are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she remained sitting on the stone and made no answer. He went with
      heavy footsteps, very heavy footsteps. And the blue sea grew dark and the
      sun ceased shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pal, Pal, where is this to lead to?&rdquo; he sighed, as he stepped over the
      fence of the cemetery. &ldquo;I wish I lay there, with a wooden cross to mark my
      place, among the roots of the trees. But I am sure I couldn&rsquo;t rest, if I
      were there without her! Oh! Gurli! Gurli!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything has gone wrong, now, mother,&rdquo; said the captain on a chilly
      autumn day to his mother-in-law, to whom he was paying a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Willy, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday they met at our house. On the day before yesterday at the
      Princess&rsquo;s. Little Alice was suddenly taken ill. It was unfortunate, of
      course, but I didn&rsquo;t dare to send for Gurli, for fear she might think that
      it was done on purpose to annoy her! Oh! when once one has lost faith....
      I asked a friend at the Admiralty yesterday whether it was legal in Sweden
      to kill one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s friends with tobacco smoke. I was told it wasn&rsquo;t, and
      that even if it were it was better not to do it, for fear of doing more
      harm than good. If only it happened to be an admirer! I should take him by
      the neck and throw him out of the window. What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult matter, Willy, dear, but we shall be able to think of a
      way out of it. You can&rsquo;t go on living like a bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke very plainly to her, a day or two ago. I told her that she would
      lose you if she didn&rsquo;t mend her ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said you had a right to do as you liked with your body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And she, too? A fine theory! My hair is fast turning grey,
      mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good old scheme to make a wife jealous. It&rsquo;s generally kill or
      cure, for if there is any love left, it brings it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, I know, there is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, there is. Love doesn&rsquo;t die suddenly; it gets used up in the
      course of the years, perhaps. Have a flirtation with Ottilia, and we shall
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flirt with Ottilia? With Ottilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it. Aren&rsquo;t you up in any of the subjects which interest her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes! They are deep in statistics, now. Fallen women, infectious
      diseases. If I could lead the conversation to mathematics! I am well up in
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! Begin with mathematics&mdash;by and by put her shawl round
      her shoulders and button her overshoes. Take her home in the evening.
      Drink her health and kiss her when Gurli is sure to see it. If necessary,
      be a little officious. She won&rsquo;t be angry, believe me. And give her a big
      dose of mathematics, so big that Gurli has no option but to sit and listen
      to it quietly. Come again in a week&rsquo;s time and tell me the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain went home, read the latest pamphlets on immorality and at once
      started to carry out his scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he called on his mother-in-law, serene and smiling, and
      greatly enjoying a glass of good sherry. He was in high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me all about it,&rdquo; said the old woman, pushing her spectacles up
      on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was difficult work at first,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;for she distrusted me. She
      thought I was making fun of her. Then I mentioned the effect which the
      computation of probabilities had had on the statistics of morality in
      America. I told her that it had simply been epoch-making. She knew nothing
      about it, but the subject attracted her. I gave her examples and proved in
      figures that it was possible to calculate with a certain amount of
      probability the percentage of women who are bound to fall. She was amazed.
      I saw that her curiosity was aroused and that she was eager to provide
      herself with a trump-card for the next meeting. Gurli was pleased to see
      that Ottilia and I were making friends, and did everything to further my
      scheme. She pushed her into my room and closed the door; and there we sat
      all afternoon, making calculations. The old witch was happy, for she felt
      that she was making use of me, and after three hours&rsquo; work we were fast
      friends. At supper my wife found that such old friends as Ottilia and I
      ought to call one another by their Christian names. I brought out my good
      old sherry to celebrate the occasion. And then I kissed her on the lips,
      may God forgive me for my sins! Gurli looked a little startled, but did
      not seem to mind. She was radiant with happiness. The sherry was strong
      and Ottilia was weak. I wrapped her in her cloak and took her home. I
      gently squeezed her arm and told her the names of the stars. She became
      enthusiastic! She had always loved the stars, but had never been able to
      remember their names. The poor women were not allowed to acquire any
      knowledge. Her enthusiasm grew and we parted as the very best of friends
      who had been kept apart through misunderstanding each other for such a
      long, long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the next day more mathematics. We worked until supper time. Gurli came
      in once or twice and gave us an encouraging nod. At supper we talked of
      nothing but stars and mathematics, and Gurli sat there, silently,
      listening to us. Again I took her home. On my way back I met a friend. We
      went to the Grand Hotel and drank a glass of punch. It was one o&rsquo;clock
      when I came home. Gurli was still up waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been all this time, William?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the devil entered into my soul and I replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We had such a lot to talk about that I forgot all about the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> blow struck home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nice to run about half the night with a young woman,&rsquo; 
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pretended to be embarrassed and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If one has so much to say to one another, one forgets sometimes what is
      nice and what is not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What on earth did you talk about?&rsquo; asked Gurli, pouting. &ldquo;&lsquo;I really
      can&rsquo;t remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You managed very well, my boy,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the third day,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;Gurli came in with her
      needlework and remained in the room until the lesson in mathematics was
      over. Supper was not quite as merry as usual, but on the other hand, very
      astronomical. I assisted the old witch with her overshoes, a fact which
      made a great impression on Gurli. When Ottilia said good-night, she only
      offered her cheek to be kissed. On the way home I pressed her arm and
      talked of the sympathy of souls and of the stars as the home of the souls.
      I went to the Grand Hotel, had some punch and arrived home at two o&rsquo;clock.
      Gurli was still up; I saw it, but I went straight to my room, like the
      bachelor I was, and Gurli did not like to follow me and ply me with
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the following day I gave Ottilia a lesson in astronomy. Gurli declared
      that she was much interested and would like to be present; but Ottilia
      said we were already too far advanced and she would instruct her in the
      rudiments later on. This annoyed Gurli and she went away. We had a great
      deal of sherry for supper. When Ottilia thanked me for a jolly evening, I
      put my arm round her waist and kissed her. Gurli grew pale. When I
      buttoned her overshoes, I ... I....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind me,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;I am an old woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;All the same, mother, she&rsquo;s not so bad, really she isn&rsquo;t. But
      when I was going to put on my overcoat, I found to my astonishment the
      maid waiting in the hall, ready to accompany Ottilia home. Gurli made
      excuses for me; she said I had caught a cold on the previous evening, and
      that she was afraid the night air might do me harm. Ottilia looked
      self-conscious and left without kissing Gurli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had promised to show Ottilia some astronomical instruments at the
      College at twelve o&rsquo;clock on the following day. She kept her appointment,
      but she was much depressed. She had been to see Gurli, who had treated her
      very unkindly, so she said. She could not imagine why. When I came home to
      dinner I found a great change in Gurli. She was cold and mute as a fish. I
      could see that she was suffering. Now was the time to apply the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What did you say to Ottilia?&rsquo; I commenced. &lsquo;She was so unhappy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did I say to her? Well, I said to her that she was a flirt. That&rsquo;s
      what I said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you say such a thing?&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Surely, you&rsquo;re not jealous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I! Jealous of her!&rsquo; she burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what puzzles me, for I am sure an intelligent and sensible
      person like Ottilia could never have designs on another woman&rsquo;s husband!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; (she was coming to the point) &lsquo;but another woman&rsquo;s husband might
      have designs on her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Huhuhu!&rsquo; she went for me tooth and nail. I took Ottilia&rsquo;s part; Gurli
      called her an old maid; I continued to champion her. On this afternoon
      Ottilia did not turn up. She wrote a chilly letter, making excuses and
      winding up by saying she could see that she was not wanted. I protested
      and suggested that I should go and fetch her. That made Gurli wild! She
      was sure that I was in love with Ottilia and cared no more for herself.
      She knew that she was only a silly girl, who didn&rsquo;t know anything, was no
      good at anything, and&mdash;huhuhu!&mdash;could never understand
      mathematics. I sent for a sleigh and we went for a ride. In a hotel,
      overlooking the sea, we drank mulled wine and had an excellent little
      supper. It was just as if we were having our wedding day over again, and
      then we drove home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;?&rdquo; asked the old woman, looking at him over her
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then? H&rsquo;m! May God forgive me for my sins! I seduced my own little
      wife. What do you say now, granny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that you did very well, my boy! And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then? Since then everything has been all right, and now we discuss
      the education of the children and the emancipation of women from
      superstition and old-maidishness, from sentimentality and the devil and
      his ablative, but we talk when we are alone together and that is the best
      way of avoiding misunderstandings. Don&rsquo;t you think so, old lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Willy, dear, and now I shall come and pay you a call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come! And you will see the dolls dance and the larks and the
      woodpeckers sing and chirrup; you will see a home filled with happiness up
      to the roof, for there is no one there waiting for miracles which only
      happen in fairy tales. You will see a real doll&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PHOENIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wild strawberries were getting ripe when he met her for the first time
      at the vicarage. He had met many girls before, but when he saw <i>her</i>
      he knew; this was she! But he did not dare to tell her so, and she only
      teased him for he was still at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an undergraduate when he met her for the second time. And as he put
      his arms round her and kissed her, he saw showers of rockets, heard the
      ringing of bells and bugle calls, and felt the earth trembling under his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman at the age of fourteen. Her young bosom seemed to be
      waiting for hungry little mouths and eager baby fists. With her firm and
      elastic step, her round and swelling hips, she looked fit to bear at any
      moment a baby under her heart. Her hair was of a pale gold, like clarified
      honey, and surrounded her face like an aureole; her eyes were two flames
      and her skin was as soft as a glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were engaged to be married and billed and cooed in the wood like the
      birds in the garden under the lime trees; life lay before them like a
      sunny meadow which the scythe had not yet touched. But he had to pass his
      examinations in mining first, and that would take him,&mdash;including the
      journey abroad&mdash;ten years. Ten years!
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the University. In the summer he came back to the vicarage
      and found her every bit as beautiful. Three summers he came&mdash;and the
      fourth time she was pale. There were tiny red lines in the corners of her
      nose and her shoulders drooped a little. When the summer returned for the
      sixth time, she was taking iron. In the seventh she went to a
      watering-place. In the eighth she suffered from tooth-ache and her nerves
      were out of order. Her hair had lost its gloss, her voice had grown
      shrill, her nose was covered with little black specks; she had lost her
      figure, dragged her feet, and her cheeks were hollow. In the winter she
      had an attack of nervous fever, and her hair had to be cut off. When it
      grew again, it was a dull brown. He had fallen in love with a
      golden-haired girl of fourteen&mdash;brunettes did not attract him&mdash;and
      he married a woman of twenty-four, with dull brown hair, who refused to
      wear her dresses open at the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of all this he loved her. His love was less passionate than
      it had been; it had become calm and steadfast. And there was nothing in
      the little mining-town which could disturb their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bore him two boys, but he was always wishing for a girl. And at last a
      fair-haired baby girl arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the apple of his eye, and as she grew up she resembled her mother
      more and more. When she was eight years old, she was just what her mother
      had been. And the father devoted all his spare time to his little
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housework had coarsened the mother&rsquo;s hands. Her nose had lost its
      shape and her temples had fallen in. Constant stooping over the kitchen
      range had made her a little round-shouldered. Father and mother met only
      at meals and at night. They did not complain, but things had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the daughter was the father&rsquo;s delight. It was almost as if he were in
      love with her. He saw in her the re-incarnation of her mother, his first
      impression of her, as beautiful as it had been fleeting. He was almost
      self-conscious in her company and never went into her room when she was
      dressing. He worshipped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one morning the child remained in bed and refused to get up. Mama put
      it down to laziness, but papa sent for the doctor. The shadow of the angel
      of death lay over the house: the child was suffering from diphtheria.
      Either father or mother must take the other children away. He refused. The
      mother took them to a little house in one of the suburbs and the father
      remained at home to nurse the invalid. There she lay! The house was
      disinfected with sulphur which turned the gilded picture frames black and
      tarnished the silver on the dressing-table. He walked through the empty
      rooms in silent anguish, and at night, alone in his big bed, he felt like
      a widower. He bought toys for the little girl, and she smiled at him as he
      sat on the edge of the bed trying to amuse her with a Punch and Judy show,
      and asked after mama and her little brothers. And the father had to go and
      stand in the street before the house in the suburbs, and nod to his wife
      who was looking at him from the window, and blow kisses to the children.
      And his wife signalled to him with sheets of blue and red paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a day came when the little girl took no more pleasure in Punch and
      Judy, and ceased smiling; and ceased talking too, for Death had stretched
      out his long bony arm and suffocated her. It had been a hard struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the mother returned, full of remorse because she had deserted her
      little daughter. There was great misery in the home, and great
      wretchedness. When the doctor wanted to make a post mortem examination,
      the father objected. No knife should touch her, for she was not dead to
      him; but his resistance was overborne. Then he flew into a passion and
      tried to kick and bite the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had bedded her into the earth, he built a monument over her
      grave, and for a whole year he visited it every day. In the second year he
      did not go quite so often. His work was heavy and he had little spare
      time. He began to feel the burden of the years; his step was less elastic;
      his wound was healing. Sometimes he felt ashamed when he realised that he
      was mourning less and less for his child as time went by; and finally he
      forgot all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more girls were born to him, but it was not the same thing; the void
      left by the one who had passed away could never be filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was a hard struggle. The young wife who had once been like&mdash;like
      no other woman on earth, had gradually lost her glamour; the gilding had
      worn off the home which had once been so bright and beautiful. The
      children had bruised and dented their mother&rsquo;s wedding presents, spoiled
      the beds and kicked the legs of the furniture. The stuffing of the sofa
      was plainly visible here and there, and the piano had not been opened for
      years. The noise made by the children had drowned the music and the voices
      had become harsh. The words of endearment had been cast off with the baby
      clothes, caresses had deteriorated into a sort of massage. They were
      growing old and weary. Papa was no longer on his knees before mama, he sat
      in his shabby armchair and asked her for a match when he wanted to light
      his pipe. Yes, they were growing old.
    </p>
    <p>
      When papa had reached his fiftieth year, mama died. Then the past awoke
      and knocked at his heart. When her broken body, which the last agony had
      robbed of its few remaining charms, had been laid in its grave, the
      picture of his fourteen-year-old sweetheart arose in his memory. It was
      for her, whom he had lost so long ago that he mourned now, and with his
      yearning for her came remorse. But he had never been unkind to the old
      mama; he had been faithful to the fourteen-year-old vicar&rsquo;s daughter whom
      he had worshipped on his knees but had never led to the altar, for he had
      married an anaemic young woman of twenty-four. If he were to be quite
      candid, he would have to confess that it was she for whom he mourned; it
      was true, he also missed the good cooking and unremitting care of the old
      mama, but that was a different thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on more intimate terms with his children, now; some of them had
      left the old nest, but others were still at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had bored his friends for a whole year with anecdotes of the
      deceased, an extraordinary coincidence happened. He met a young girl of
      eighteen, with fair hair, and a striking resemblance to his late wife, as
      she had been at fourteen. He saw in this coincidence the finger of a
      bountiful providence, willing to bestow on him at last the first one, the
      well-beloved. He fell in love with her because she resembled the first
      one. And he married her. He had got her at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his children, especially the girls, resented his second marriage. They
      found the relationship between their father and step-mother improper; in
      their opinion he had been unfaithful to their mother. And they left his
      house and went out into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was happy! And his pride in his young wife exceeded even his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the aftermath!&rdquo; said his old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a year had gone by, the young wife presented him with a baby. Papa,
      of course, was no longer used to a baby&rsquo;s crying, and wanted his night&rsquo;s
      rest. He insisted on a separate bed-room for himself, heedless of his
      wife&rsquo;s tears; really, women were a nuisance sometimes. And, moreover, she
      was jealous of his first wife. He had been fool enough to tell her of the
      extraordinary likeness which existed between the two and had let her read
      his first wife&rsquo;s love-letters. She brooded over these facts now that he
      neglected her. She realised that she had inherited all the first one&rsquo;s pet
      names, that she was only her understudy, as it were. It irritated her and
      the attempt to win him for herself led her into all sorts of mischief. But
      she only succeeded in boring him, and in silently comparing the two women,
      his verdict was entirely in favour of the first one. She had been so much
      more gentle than the second who exasperated him. The longing for his
      children, whom he had driven from their home increased his regret, and his
      sleep was disturbed by bad dreams for he was haunted by the idea that he
      had been unfaithful to his first wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      His home was no longer a happy one. He had done a deed, which he would
      much better have left undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to spend a good deal of time at his club. But now his wife was
      furious. He had deceived her. He was an old man and he had better look
      out! An old man who left his young wife so much alone ran a certain risk.
      He might regret it some day!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old? She called him old? He would show her that he was not old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shared the same room again. But now matters were seven times worse.
      He did not want to be bothered with the baby at night. The proper place
      for babies was the nursery. No! he hadn&rsquo;t thought so in the case of the
      first wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to submit to the torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice he had believed in the miracle of Phoenix rising from the ashes of
      his fourteen year old love, first in his daughter, then in his second
      wife. But in his memory lived the first one only, the little one from the
      vicarage, whom he had met when the wild strawberries were ripe, and kissed
      under the lime trees in the wood, but whom he had never married.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as his sun was setting and his days grew short, he saw in his
      dark hours only the picture of the old mama, who had been kind to him and
      his children, who had never scolded, who was plain, who cooked the meals
      and patched the little boys&rsquo; knickers and the skirts of the little girls.
      His flush of victory being over, he was able to see facts clearly. He
      wondered whether it was not, after all, the old mama who had been the real
      true Phoenix, rising, calm and beautiful, from the ashes of the fourteen
      year old bird of paradise, laying its eggs, plucking the feathers from its
      breast to line the nest for the young ones, and nourishing them with its
      life-blood until it died.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered ... but when at last he laid his weary head on the pillow,
      never again to lift it up, he was convinced that it was so.

    <h2>
      ROMEO AND JULIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening the husband came home with a roll of music under his arm and
      said to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us play duets after supper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romeo and Julia, arranged for the piano. Do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I do,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t remember ever having seen
      it on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s splendid! To me it is like a dream of my youth, but I&rsquo;ve only
      heard it once, and that was about twenty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper, when the children had been put to bed and the house lay
      silent, the husband lighted the candles on the piano. He looked at the
      lithographed title-page and read the title: Romeo and Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Gounod&rsquo;s most beautiful composition,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
      believe that it will be too difficult for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As usual his wife undertook to play the treble and they began. D major,
      common time, <i>allegro giusto</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the husband, when they had finished the
      overture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;es,&rdquo; admitted the wife, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the martial music,&rdquo; said the husband; &ldquo;it is exceptionally fine. I
      can remember the splendid choruses at the Royal Theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They played a march.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wasn&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo; asked the husband, triumphantly, as if he had
      composed &ldquo;Romeo and Julia&rdquo; himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it rather sounds like a brass band,&rdquo; answered the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband&rsquo;s honour and good taste were involved; he looked for the
      Moonshine Aria in the fourth act. After a little searching he came across
      an aria for soprano. That must be it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tram-tramtram, tram-tramtram, went the bass; it was very easy to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said his wife, when it was over, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think very much
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband, quite depressed, admitted that it reminded him of a barrel
      organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so all along,&rdquo; confessed the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I find it antiquated, too. I am surprised that Gounod should be out
      of date, already,&rdquo; he added dejectedly. &ldquo;Would you like to go on playing?
      Let&rsquo;s try the Cavatina and the Trio; I particularly remember the soprano;
      she was divine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they stopped playing, the husband looked crestfallen and put the
      music away, as if he wanted to shut the door on the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a glass of beer,&rdquo; he said. They sat down at the table and had
      a glass of beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary,&rdquo; he began, after a little while, &ldquo;I never realised
      before that we&rsquo;ve grown old, for we really must have vied with Romeo and
      Julia as to who should age faster. It&rsquo;s twenty years ago since I heard the
      opera for the first time. I was a newly fledged undergraduate then, I had
      many friends and the future smiled at me. I was immensely proud of the
      first down on my upper lip and my little college cap, and I remember as if
      it were to-day, the evening when Fritz, Phil and myself went to hear this
      opera. We had heard &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; some years before and were great admirers of
      Gounod&rsquo;s genius. But Romeo beat all our expectations. The music roused our
      wildest enthusiasm. Now both my friends are dead. Fritz, who was
      ambitious, was a private secretary when he died, Phil a medical student; I
      who aspired to the position of a minister of state have to content myself
      with that of a regimental judge. The years have passed by quickly and
      imperceptibly. Of course I have noticed that the lines under my eyes have
      grown deeper and that my hair has turned grey at the temples, but I should
      never have thought that we had travelled so far on the road to the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, we&rsquo;ve grown old; our children could teach us that. And you
      must see it in me too, although you don&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know only too well, my dear,&rdquo; continued the wife, sadly; &ldquo;I know
      that I am beginning to lose my good looks, that my hair is growing thin,
      that I shall soon lose my front teeth....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just consider how quickly everything passes away&rdquo;&mdash;interrupted her
      husband. &ldquo;It seems to me that one grows old much more rapidly now-a-days,
      than one used to do. In my father&rsquo;s house Haydn and Mozart were played a
      great deal, although they were dead long before he was born. And now&mdash;now
      Gounod has grown old-fashioned already! How distressing it is to meet
      again the ideals of one&rsquo;s youth under these altered circumstances! And how
      horrible it is to feel old age approaching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and sat down again at the piano; he took the music and turned
      over the pages as if he were looking for keepsakes, locks of hair, dried
      flowers and ends of ribbon in the drawer of a writing-table. His eyes were
      riveted on the black notes which looked like little birds climbing up and
      down a wire fencing; but where were the spring songs, the passionate
      protestations, the jubilant avowals of the rosy days of first love? The
      notes stared back at him like strangers; as if the memory of life&rsquo;s
      spring-time were grown over with weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was it; the strings were covered with dust, the sounding board
      was dried up, the felt worn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy sigh echoed through the room, heavy as if it came from a hollow
      chest, and then silence fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the same, it is strange,&rdquo; the husband said suddenly, &ldquo;that the
      glorious prologue is missing in this arrangement. I remember distinctly
      that there was a prologue with an accompaniment of harps and a chorus
      which went like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He softly hummed the tune, which bubbled up like a stream in a mountain
      glen; note succeeded note, his face cleared, his lips smiled, the lines
      disappeared, his fingers touched the keys, and drew from them melodies,
      powerful, caressing and full of eternal youth, while with a strong and
      ringing voice he sang the part of the bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife started from her melancholy reverie and listened with tears in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you singing?&rdquo; she asked, full of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romeo and Julia! Our Romeo and our Julia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up from the music stool and pushed the music towards his
      astonished wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! This was the Romeo of our uncles and aunts, this was&mdash;read it&mdash;Bellini!
      Oh! We are not old, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife looked at the thick, glossy hair of her husband, his smooth brow
      and flashing eyes, with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you? You look like a young girl. We have allowed old Bellini to make
      fools of us. I felt that something was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling, I thought so first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably you did; that is because you are younger than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And husband and wife, like a couple of children, laughingly quarrel over
      the question of which of them is the elder of the two, and cannot
      understand how they could have discovered lines and grey hairs where there
      are none.

    <h2>
      PROLIFICACY
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was a supernumerary at the Board of Trade and drew a salary of twelve
      hundred crowns. He had married a young girl without a penny; for love, as
      he himself said, to be no longer compelled to go to dances and run about
      the streets, as his friends maintained. But be that as it may, the life of
      the newly-wedded couple was happy enough to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cheaply married people can live,&rdquo; he said one day, after the wedding
      was a thing of the past. The same sum which had been barely enough to
      cover the wants of the bachelor now sufficed for husband and wife. Really,
      marriage was an excellent institution. One had all one&rsquo;s requirements
      within one&rsquo;s four walls: club, cafe, everything; no more bills of fare, no
      tips, no inquisitive porter watching one as one went out with one&rsquo;s wife
      in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life smiled at him, his strength increased and he worked for two. Never in
      all his life had he felt so full of overflowing energy; he jumped out of
      bed as soon as he woke up in the morning, buoyantly, and in the highest
      spirits, he was rejuvenated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When two months had elapsed, long before his new circumstances had begun
      to pall, his wife whispered a certain piece of information into his ear.
      New joys! New cares! But cares so pleasant to bear! It was necessary,
      however, to increase their income at once, so as to receive the unknown
      world-citizen in a manner befitting his dignity. He managed to obtain an
      order for a translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby-clothes lay scattered about all over the furniture, a cradle stood
      waiting in the hall, and at last a splendid boy arrived in this world of
      sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was delighted. And yet he could not help a vague feeling of
      uneasiness whenever he thought of the future. Income and expenditure did
      not balance. Nothing remained but to reduce his dress allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His frock coat began to look threadbare at the seams; his shirt front was
      hidden underneath a large tie, his trousers were frayed. It was an
      undeniable fact that the porters at the office looked down on him on
      account of his shabbiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this he was compelled to lengthen his working day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the first and last,&rdquo; he said. But how was it to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at a loss to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later his wife prepared him in carefully chosen words that
      his paternal joys would soon be doubled. It would not be true to say that
      he rejoiced greatly at the news. But there was no alternative now; he must
      travel along the road he had chosen, even if married life should prove to
      be anything but cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he thought, his face brightening, &ldquo;the younger one will
      inherit the baby-clothes of his elder brother. This will save a good deal
      of expense, and there will be food enough for them&mdash;I shall be able
      to feed them just as well as others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the second baby was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going it,&rdquo; said a friend of his, who was a married man himself,
      but father of one child only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a man to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use his common-sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use his common-sense? But, my dear fellow, a man gets married in order to
      ... I mean to say, not only in order to ... but yet in order to.... Well,
      anyhow, we are married and that settles the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Let me tell you something, my dear boy; if you are at all
      hoping for promotion it is absolutely necessary that you should wear clean
      linen, trousers which are not frayed at the bottom, and a hat which is not
      of a rusty brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sensible man whispered sensible words into his ear. As the result,
      the poor husband was put on short commons in the midst of plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now his troubles began.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start with his nerves went to pieces, he suffered from insomnia and did
      his work badly. He consulted a doctor. The prescription cost him three
      crowns; and such a prescription! He was to stop working; he had worked too
      hard, his brain was overtaxed. To stop work would mean starvation for all
      of them, and to work spelt death, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on working.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he was sitting at his desk, stooping over endless rows of
      figures, he had an attack of faintness, slipped off his chair and fell to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit to a specialist&mdash;eighteen crowns. A new prescription; he must
      ask for sick leave at once, take riding exercise every morning and have
      steak and a glass of port for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding exercise and port!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the worst feature of the whole business was a feeling of alienation
      from his wife which had sprung up in his heart&mdash;he did not know
      whence it came. He was afraid to go near her and at the same time he
      longed for her presence. He loved her, loved her still, but a certain
      bitterness was mingled with his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are growing thin,&rdquo; said a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe I&rsquo;ve grown thinner,&rdquo; said the poor husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are playing a dangerous game, old boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A married man in half mourning! Take care, my friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re driving at.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to go against the wind for any length of time. Set all
      sails and run, old chap, and you will see that everything will come right.
      Believe me, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. You understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took no notice of the advice for a time, fully aware of the fact that a
      man&rsquo;s income does not increase in proportion to his family; at the same
      time he had no longer any doubt about the cause of his malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was summer again. The family had gone into the country. On a beautiful
      evening husband and wife were strolling along the steep shore, in the
      shade of the alder trees, resplendent in their young green. They sat down
      on the turf, silent and depressed. He was morose and disheartened; gloomy
      thoughts revolved behind his aching brow. Life seemed a great chasm which
      had opened to engulf all he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of the probable loss of his appointment; his chief had been
      annoyed at his second application for sick leave. He complained of the
      conduct of his colleagues, he felt himself deserted by everyone; but the
      fact which hurt him more than anything else was the knowledge that she,
      too, had grown tired of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but she hadn&rsquo;t! She loved him every bit as much as she did in those
      happy days when they were first engaged. How could he doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t doubt it; but he had suffered so much, he wasn&rsquo;t master of
      his own thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his burning cheek against hers, put his arm round her and
      covered her eyes with passionate kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gnats danced their nuptial dance above the birch tree without a
      thought of the thousands of young ones which their ecstasy would call into
      being; the carp laid their eggs in the reed grass, careless of the
      millions of their kind to which they gave birth; the swallow made love in
      broad daylight, not in the least afraid of the consequences of their
      irregular liaisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden he sprang to his feet and stretched himself like a sleeper
      awakening from a long sleep, which had been haunted by evil dreams, he
      drank in the balmy air in deep draughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; whispered his wife, while a crimson blush spread over
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that I live, that I breathe again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And radiant, with laughing face and shining eyes, he held out his arms to
      her, picked her up as if she were a baby and pressed his lips to her
      forehead. The muscles of his legs swelled until they looked like the
      muscles of the leg of an antique god, he held his body erect like a young
      tree and intoxicated with strength and happiness, he carried his beloved
      burden as far as the footpath where he put her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will strain yourself, sweetheart,&rdquo; she said, making a vain attempt to
      free herself from his encircling arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, you darling! I could carry you to the end of the earth, and I
      shall carry you, all of you, no matter how many you are now, or how many
      you may yet become.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they returned home, arm in arm, their hearts singing with gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst, sweet love, one must admit that it is
      very easy to jump that abyss which separates body and soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a thing to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only realised it before, I should have been less unhappy. Oh!
      those idealists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they entered their cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good old times had returned and had, apparently, come to stay. The
      husband went to work to his office as before. They lived again through
      love&rsquo;s spring time. No doctor was required and the high spirits never
      flagged.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the third christening, however, he came to the conclusion that
      matters were serious and started playing his old game with the inevitable
      results: doctor, sick-leave, riding-exercise, port! But there must be an
      end of it, at all costs. Every time the balance-sheet showed a deficit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, finally, his whole nervous system went out of joint, he let
      nature have her own way. Immediately expenses went up and he was beset
      with difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a poor man, it is true, but on the other hand he was not blest
      with too many of this world&rsquo;s riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, old girl,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;it will be the
      same old story over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it will, my dear,&rdquo; replied the poor woman, who, in addition
      to her duties as a mother, had to do the whole work of the house now.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the birth of her fourth child, the work grew too hard for her and a
      nursemaid had to be engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it must stop,&rdquo; avowed the disconsolate husband. &ldquo;This must be the
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poverty looked in at the door. The foundations on which the house was
      built were tottering.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, at the age of thirty, in the very prime of their life, the young
      husband and wife found themselves condemned to celibacy. He grew moody,
      his complexion became grey and his eyes lost their lustre. Her rich beauty
      faded, her fine figure wasted away, and she suffered all the sorrows of a
      mother who sees her children growing up in poverty and rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as she was standing in the kitchen, frying herrings, a neighbour
      called in for a friendly chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;m not up to very much. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not at all well. Married life is a misery if one has to be
      constantly on one&rsquo;s guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you are the only one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what my husband said to me the other day? One ought to spare
      the draught cattle! And I suffer under it all, I can tell you. No, there&rsquo;s
      no happiness in marriage. Either husband or wife is bound to suffer. It&rsquo;s
      one or the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about the men of science who grow fat at the expense of the
      Government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have to think of so many things, and moreover, it is improper to
      write about such problems; they must not be discussed openly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that would be the first necessity!&rdquo; And the two women fell to
      discussing their bitter experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following summer they were compelled to remain in town; they were
      living in a basement with a view of the gutter, the smell of which was so
      objectionable that it was impossible to keep the windows open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife did needlework in the same room in which the children were
      playing; the husband, who had lost his appointment on account of his
      extreme shabbiness, was copying a manuscript in the adjoining room, and
      grumbling at the children&rsquo;s noise. Hard words were bandied through the
      open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Whitsuntide. In the afternoon the husband was lying on the ragged
      leather sofa, gazing at a window on the other side of the street. He was
      watching a woman of evil reputation who was dressing for her evening
      stroll. A spray of lilac and two oranges were lying by the side of her
      looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was fastening her dress without taking the least notice of his
      inquisitive glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not having a bad time,&rdquo; mused the celibate, suddenly kindled into
      passion. &ldquo;One lives but once in this world, and one must live one&rsquo;s life,
      happen what will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife entered the room and caught sight of the object of his scrutiny.
      Her eyes blazed; the last feeble sparks of her dead love glowed under the
      ashes and revealed themselves in a temporary flash of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better take the children to the Zoo?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make a public show of our misery? No, thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so hot in here. I shall have to pull down the blinds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better open a window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He divined his wife&rsquo;s thoughts and rose to do it himself. Out there, on
      the edge of the pavement, his four little ones were sitting, in close
      proximity of the waste pipes. Their feet were in the dry gutter, and they
      were playing with orange peels which they had found in the sweepings of
      the road. The sight stabbed his heart, and he felt a lump rising in his
      throat. But poverty had so blunted his feelings that he remained standing
      at the window with his arms crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once two filthy streams gushed from the waste pipes, inundated the
      gutter and saturated the feet of the children who screamed, half
      suffocated by the stench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the children ready as quickly as you can,&rdquo; he called, giving way at
      the heart-rending scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father pushed the perambulator with the baby, the other children clung
      to the hands and skirts of the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the cemetery with its dark-stemmed lime-trees, their usual
      place of refuge; here the trees grew luxuriantly, as if the soil were
      enriched by the bodies which lay buried underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells were ringing for evening prayers. The inmates of the poorhouse
      flocked to the church and sat down in the pews left vacant by their
      wealthy owners, who had attended to their souls at the principal service
      of the day, and were now driving in their carriages to the Royal Deer
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children climbed about the shallow graves, most of which were
      decorated with armorial bearings and inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Husband and wife sat down on a seat and placed the perambulator, in which
      the baby lay sucking at its bottle, by their side. Two puppies were
      disporting themselves on a grave close by, half hidden by the high grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young and well dressed couple, leading by the hand a little girl clothed
      in silk and velvet, passed the seat on which they sat. The poor copyist
      raised his eyes to the young dandy and recognised a former colleague from
      the Board of Trade who, however, did not seem to see him. A feeling of
      bitter envy seized him with such intensity that he felt more humiliated by
      this &ldquo;ignoble sentiment&rdquo; than by his deplorable condition. Was he angry
      with the other man because he filled a position which he himself had
      coveted? Surely not. But of a sense of justice, and his suffering was all
      the deeper because it was shared by the whole class of the disinherited.
      He was convinced that the inmates of the poorhouse, bowed down under the
      yoke of public charity, envied his wife; and he was quite sure that many
      of the aristocrats who slept all around him in their graves, under their
      coats of arms, would have envied him his children if it had been their lot
      to die without leaving an heir to their estates. Certainly, nobody under
      the sun enjoyed complete happiness, but why did the plums always fall to
      the lot of those who were already sitting in the lap of luxury? And how
      was it that the prizes always fell to the organisers of the great lottery?
      The disinherited had to be content with the mass said at evening prayers;
      to their share fell morality and those virtues which the others despised
      and of which they had no need because the gates of heaven opened readily
      enough to their wealth. But what about the good and just God who had
      distributed His gifts so unevenly? It would be better, indeed, to live
      one&rsquo;s life without this unjust God, who had, moreover, candidly admitted
      that the &ldquo;wind blew where it listed&rdquo;; had He not himself confessed, in
      these words, that He did not interfere in the concerns of man? But failing
      the church, where should we look for comfort? And yet, why ask for
      comfort? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be far better to strive to make such arrangements
      that no comfort was needed? Wouldn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      His speculations were interrupted by his eldest daughter who asked him for
      a leaf of the lime-tree, which she wanted for a sunshade for her doll. He
      stepped on the seat and raised his hand to break off a little twig, when a
      constable appeared and rudely ordered him not to touch the trees. A fresh
      humiliation. At the same time the constable requested him not to allow his
      children to play on the graves, which was against the regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go home,&rdquo; said the distressed father. &ldquo;How carefully they
      guard the interests of the dead, and how indifferent they are to the
      interests of the living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and began to work. He had to copy the manuscript of an
      academical treatise on over-population.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject interested him and he read the contents of the whole book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young author who belonged to what was called the ethical school, was
      preaching against vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What vice?&rdquo; mused the copyist. &ldquo;That which is responsible for our
      existence? Which the priest orders us to indulge in at every wedding when
      he says: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manuscript ran on: Propagation, without holy matrimony, is a
      destructive vice, because the fate of the children, who do not receive
      proper care and nursing, is a sad one. In the case of married couples, on
      the other hand, it becomes a sacred duty to indulge one&rsquo;s desires. This is
      proved, among other things, by the fact that the law protects even the
      female ovum, and it is right that it should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; thought the copyist, &ldquo;there is a providence for legitimate
      children, but not for illegitimate ones Oh! this young philosopher! And
      the law which protects the female ovum! What business, then, have those
      microscopic things to detach themselves at every change of the moon? Those
      sacred objects ought to be most carefully guarded by the police!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these futilities he had to copy in his best handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      They overflowed with morality, but contained not a single word of
      enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral or rather the immoral gist of the whole argument was: There is a
      God who feeds and clothes all children born in wedlock; a God in His
      heaven, probably, but what about the earth? Certainly, it was said that He
      came to earth once and allowed himself to be crucified, after vainly
      trying to establish something like order in the confused affairs of
      mankind; He did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher wound up by screaming himself hoarse in trying to convince
      his audience that the abundant supply of wheat was an irrefutable proof
      that the problem of over-population did not exist; that the doctrine of
      Malthus was not only false, but criminal, socially as well as morally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the poor father of a family who had not tasted wheaten bread for
      years, laid down the manuscript and urged his little ones to fill
      themselves with gruel made of rye flour and bluish milk, a dish which
      satisfied their craving, but contained no nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wretched, not because he considered water gruel objectionable, but
      because he had lost his precious sense of humour, that magician who can
      transform the dark rye into golden wheat; almighty love, emptying his horn
      of plenty over his poor home, had vanished. The children had become
      burdens, and the once beloved wife a secret enemy despised and despising
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the cause of all this unhappiness? The want of bread! And yet the
      large store houses of the new world were breaking down under the weight of
      the over-abundant supply of wheat. What a world of contradictions! The
      manner in which bread was distributed must be at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science, which has replaced religion, has no answer to give; it merely
      states facts and allows the children to die of hunger and the parents of
      thirst.

    <h2>
      AUTUMN
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had been married for ten years. Happily? Well, as happily as
      circumstances permitted. They had been running in double harness, like two
      young oxen of equal strength, each of which is conscientiously doing his
      own share.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first year of their marriage they buried many illusions and
      realised that marriage was not perfect bliss. In the second year the
      babies began to arrive, and the daily toil left them no time for brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very domesticated, perhaps too much so; his family was his world,
      the centre and pivot of which he was. The children were the radii. His
      wife attempted to be a centre, too, but never in the middle of the circle,
      for that was exclusively occupied by him, and therefore the radii fell now
      on the top of one another, now far apart, and their life lacked harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tenth year of their marriage he obtained the post of secretary to
      the Board of Prisons, and in that capacity he was obliged to travel about
      the country. This interfered seriously with his daily routine; the thought
      of leaving his world for a whole month upset him. He wondered whom he
      would miss more, his wife or his children, and he was sure he would miss
      them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eve of his departure he sat in the corner of the sofa and watched
      his portmanteau being packed. His wife was kneeling on the She brushed his
      black suit and folded it carefully, so that it should take up as little
      space as possible. He had no idea how to do these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never looked upon herself as his housekeeper, hardly as his wife,
      she was above all things mother: a mother to the children, a mother to
      him. She darned his socks without the slightest feeling of degradation,
      and asked for no thanks. She never even considered him indebted to her for
      it, for did he not give her and the children new stockings whenever they
      wanted them, and a great many other things into the bargain? But for him,
      she would have to go out and earn her own living, and the children would
      be left alone all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the sofa corner and looked at her. Now that the parting was
      imminent, he began to feel premature little twinges of longing. He gazed
      at her figure. Her shoulders were a little rounded; much bending over the
      cradle, ironing board and kitchen range had robbed her back of its
      straightness. He, too, stooped a little, the result of his toil at the
      writing-table, and he was obliged to wear spectacles. But at the moment he
      really was not thinking of himself. He noticed that her plaits were
      thinner than they had been and that a faint suggestion of silver lay on
      her hair. Had she sacrificed her beauty to him, to him alone? No, surely
      not to him, but to the little community which they formed; for, after all,
      she had also worked for herself. His hair, too, had grown thin in the
      struggle to provide for all of them. He might have retained his youth a
      little longer, if there hadn&rsquo;t been so many mouths to fill, if he had
      remained a bachelor; but he didn&rsquo;t regret his marriage for one second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a good thing for you to get away for a bit,&rdquo; said his wife;
      &ldquo;you have been too much at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are glad to get rid of me,&rdquo; he replied, not without
      bitterness; &ldquo;but I&mdash;I shall miss you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like a cat, you&rsquo;ll miss your cosy fireside, but not me; you know
      you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the kiddies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I daresay you&rsquo;ll miss them when you are away, for all your
      scolding when you are with them. No, no, I don&rsquo;t mean that you are unkind
      to them, but you do grumble a lot! All the same I won&rsquo;t be unjust, and I
      know that you love them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At supper he was very tired and depressed. He didn&rsquo;t read the evening
      paper, he wanted to talk to his wife. But she was too busy to pay much
      attention to him; she had no time to waste; moreover, her ten years&rsquo; 
      campaign in kitchen and nursery had taught her self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt more sentimental than he cared to show, and the topsy-turvydom of
      the room made him fidgety. Scraps of his daily life lay scattered all over
      chairs and chests of drawers; his black portmanteau yawned wide-open like
      a coffin; his white linen was carefully laid on the top of his black suit,
      which showed slight traces of wear and tear at the knees and elbows. It
      seemed to him that he himself was lying there, wearing a white shirt with
      a starched front. Presently they would close the coffin and carry it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning&mdash;it was in August&mdash;he rose early and
      dressed hurriedly. His nerves were unstrung. He went into the nursery and
      kissed the children who stared at him with sleepy eyes. Then he kissed his
      wife, got into a cab, and told the driver to drive him to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey, which he made in the company of his Board, did him good; it
      really was a good thing for him to get out of his groove; domesticity lay
      behind him like a stuffy bedroom, and on the arrival of the train at
      Linkoping he was in high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent dinner had been ordered at the best hotel and the remainder
      of the day was spent in eating it. They drank the health of the Lord
      Lieutenant; no one thought of the prisoners on whose behalf the journey
      had been undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, he had to face a lonely evening in his solitary room. A bed,
      two chairs, a table, a washing-stand and a wax candle, which threw its dim
      light on bare walls. He couldn&rsquo;t suppress a feeling of nervousness. He
      missed all his little comforts,&mdash;slippers, dressing-gown, pipe rack
      and writing table; all the little details which played an important part
      in his daily life. And the kiddies? And his wife? What were they doing?
      Were they all right? He became restless and depressed. When he wanted to
      wind up his watch, he found that he had left his watch-key at home. It was
      hanging on the watch-stand which his wife had given him before they were
      married. He went to bed and lit a cigar. Then he wanted a book out of his
      portmanteau and he had to get up again. Everything was packed so
      beautifully, it was a pity to disturb it. In looking for the book, he came
      across his slippers. She had forgotten nothing. Then he found the book.
      But he couldn&rsquo;t read. He lay in bed and thought of the past, of his wife,
      as she had been ten years ago. He saw her as she had been then; the
      picture of her, as she now was, disappeared in the blue-grey clouds of
      smoke which rose in rings and wreaths to the rain-stained ceiling. An
      infinite yearning came over him. Every harsh word he had ever spoken to
      her now grated on his ears; he thought remorsefully of every hour of
      anguish he had caused her. At last he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day brought much work and another banquet with a toast to
      the Prison-Governor&mdash;the prisoners were still unremembered. In the
      evening solitude, emptiness, coldness. He felt a pressing need to talk to
      her. He fetched some notepaper and sat down to write. But at the very
      outset he was confronted by a difficulty. How was he to address her?
      Whenever he had sent her a few lines to say that he would not be home for
      dinner, he had always called her &ldquo;Dear Mother.&rdquo; But now he was not going
      to write to the mother, but to his fiancée, to his beloved one. At last he
      made up his mind and commenced his letter with &ldquo;My Darling Lily,&rdquo; as he
      had done in the old days. At first he wrote slowly and with difficulty,
      for so many beautiful words and phrases seemed to have disappeared from
      the clumsy, dry language of every-day life; but as he warmed to his work,
      they awakened in his memory like forgotten melodies, valse tunes,
      fragments of poems, elder-blossoms, and swallows, sunsets on a mirror-like
      sea. All his memories of the springtime of life came dancing along in
      clouds of gossamer and enveloped her. He drew a cross at the bottom of the
      page, as lovers do, and by the side of it he wrote the words: &ldquo;Kiss here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the letter was finished and he read it through, his cheeks burnt and
      he became self-conscious. He couldn&rsquo;t account for the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow he felt that he had shown his naked soul to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this feeling he posted the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days elapsed before he received a reply. While he was waiting for
      it, he was a prey to an almost childish bashfulness and embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the answer came. He had struck the right note, and from the din
      and clamour of the nursery, and the fumes and smell of the kitchen, a song
      arose, clear and beautiful, tender and pure, like first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now an exchange of love-letters began. He wrote to her every night, and
      sometimes he sent her a postcard as well during the day. His colleagues
      didn&rsquo;t know what to think of him. He was so fastidious about his dress and
      personal appearance, that they suspected him of a love affair. And he was
      in love&mdash;in love again. He sent her his photograph, without the
      spectacles, and she sent him a lock of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their language was simple like a child&rsquo;s, and he wrote on coloured paper
      ornamented with little doves. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they? They were a long way off
      forty yet, even though the struggle for an existence had made them feel
      that they were getting old. He had neglected her during the last
      twelvemonth, not so much from indifference as from respect&mdash;he always
      saw in her the mother of his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tour of inspection was approaching its end. He was conscious of a
      certain feeling of apprehension when he thought of their meeting. He had
      corresponded with his sweetheart; should he find her in the mother and
      housewife? He dreaded a disappointment. He shrank at the thought of
      finding her with a kitchen towel in her hand, or the children clinging to
      her skirts. Their first meeting must be somewhere else, and they must meet
      alone. Should he ask her to join him at Waxholm, in the Stockholm
      Archipelago, at the hotel where they had spent so many happy hours during
      the period of their engagement? Splendid idea! There they could, for two
      whole days, re-live in memory the first beautiful spring days of their
      lives, which had flown, never to return again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and made the suggestion in an impassioned love-letter. She
      answered by return agreeing to his proposal, happy that the same idea had
      occurred to both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he arrived at Waxholm and engaged rooms at the hotel. It
      was a beautiful September day. He dined alone, in the great dining-room,
      drank a glass of wine and felt young again. Everything was so bright and
      beautiful. There was the blue sea outside; only the birch trees on the
      shore had changed their tints. In the garden the dahlias were still in
      full splendour, and the perfume of the mignonette rose from the borders of
      the flower beds. A few bees still visited the dying calyces but returned
      disappointed to their hives. The fishing boats sailed up the Sound before
      a faint breeze, and in tacking the sails fluttered and the sheets shook;
      the startled seagulls rose into the air screaming, and circled round the
      fishermen who were fishing from their boats for small herring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank his coffee on the verandah, and began to look out for the steamer
      which was due at six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restlessly, apprehensively, he paced the verandah, anxiously watching
      fiord and Sound on the side where Stockholm lay, so as to sight the
      steamer as soon as she came into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a little cloud of smoke showed like a dark patch on the horizon.
      His heart thumped against his ribs and he drank a liqueur. Then he went
      down to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he could see the funnel right in the centre of the Sound, and soon
      after he noticed the flag on the fore-topmast.... Was she really on the
      steamer, or had she been prevented from keeping the tryst? It was only
      necessary for one of the children to be ill, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be there,
      and he would have to spend a solitary night at the hotel. The children,
      who during the last few weeks had receded into the background, now stepped
      between her and him. They had hardly mentioned them in their last letters,
      just as if they had been anxious to be rid of all eyewitnesses and
      spoil-sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stamped on the creaking landing-stage and then remained standing
      motionless near a bollard staring straight at the steamer which increased
      in size as she approached, followed in her wake by a river of molten gold
      that spread over the blue, faintly rippled expanse. Now he could
      distinguish people on the upper deck, a moving crowd, and sailors busy
      with the ropes, now a fluttering speck of white near the wheel-house.
      There was no one besides him on the landing-stage, the moving white speck
      could only be meant for him, and no one would wave to him but her. He
      pulled out his handkerchief and answered her greeting, and in doing so he
      noticed that his handkerchief was not a white one; he had been using
      coloured ones for years for the sake of economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer whistled, signalled, the engines stopped, she came alongside,
      and now he recognised her. Their eyes met in greeting; the distance was
      still too great for words. Now he could see her being pushed slowly by the
      crowd across the little bridge. It was she, and yet it wasn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years stretched between her and the picture of her which he had had in
      his mind. Fashion had changed, the cut of the clothes was different. Ten
      years ago her delicate face with its olive complexion was framed by the
      cap which was then worn, and which left the forehead free; now her
      forehead was hidden by a wicked imitation of a bowler hat. Ten years ago
      the beautiful lines of her figure were clearly definable under the
      artistic draperies of her cloak which playfully now hid, now emphasised
      the curve of her shoulders and the movement of her arms; now her figure
      was completely disguised by a long driving coat which followed the lines
      of her dress but completely concealed her figure. As she stepped off the
      landing-bridge, he caught sight of her little foot with which he had
      fallen in love, when it was encased in a buttoned boot, shaped on natural
      lines; the shoe which she was now wearing resembled a pointed Chinese
      slipper, and did not allow her foot to move in those dancing rhythms which
      had bewitched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she and yet it was not she! He embraced and kissed her. She
      enquired after his health and he asked after the children. Then they
      walked up the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words came slowly and sounded dry and forced. How strange! They were
      almost shy in each other&rsquo;s presence, and neither of them mentioned the
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end he took heart of grace and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go for a walk before sunset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love to,&rdquo; she replied, taking his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went along the high-road in the direction of the little town. The
      shutters of all the summer residences were closed; the gardens plundered.
      Here and there an apple, hidden among the foliage, might still be found
      hanging on the trees, but there wasn&rsquo;t a single flower in the flower beds.
      The verandahs, stripped of their sunblinds, looked like skeletons; where
      there had been bright eyes and gay laughter, silence reigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How autumnal!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the forsaken villas look horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go and look at the house where we used to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! It will be fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed the bathing vans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over there, squeezed in between the pilot&rsquo;s and the gardener&rsquo;s cottages,
      stood the little house with its red fence, its verandah and its little
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memories of past days awoke. There was the bedroom where their first baby
      had been born. What rejoicing! What laughter! Oh! youth and gaiety! The
      rose-tree which they had planted was still there. And the strawberry-bed
      which they had made&mdash;no, it existed no longer, grass had grown over
      it. In the little plantation traces of the swing which they had put up
      were still visible, but the swing itself had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much for your beautiful letters,&rdquo; she said, gently pressing
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blushed and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they returned to the hotel, and he told her anecdotes, in connection
      with his tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ordered dinner to be served in the large dining-room at the table
      where they used to sit. They sat down without saying grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tête-à-tête dinner. He took the bread-basket and offered her the
      bread. She smiled. It was a long time since he had been so attentive. But
      dinner at a seaside hotel was a pleasant change and soon they were engaged
      in a lively conversation. It was a duet in which one of them extolled the
      days that had gone, and the other revived memories of &ldquo;once upon a time.&rdquo;
       They were re-living the past. Their eyes shone and the little lines in
      their faces disappeared. Oh! golden days! Oh! time of roses which comes
      but once, if it comes at all, and which is denied to so many of us&mdash;so
      many of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dessert he whispered a few words into the ear of the waitress; she
      disappeared and returned a few seconds later with a bottle of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Axel, what are you thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of the spring that has past, but will return again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he wasn&rsquo;t thinking of it exclusively, for at his wife&rsquo;s reproachful
      words there glided through the room, catlike, a dim vision of the nursery
      and the porridge bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      However&mdash;the atmosphere cleared again; the golden wine stirred their
      memories, and again they lost themselves in the intoxicating rapture of
      the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his elbow on the table and shaded his eyes with his hand, as if
      he were determined to shut out the present&mdash;this very present which,&mdash;after
      all, had been of his own seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed. They left the dining-room and went into the drawing-room
      which boasted a piano, ordering their coffee to be brought there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how the kiddies are?&rdquo; said she, awakening to the hard facts of
      real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and sing to me,&rdquo; he answered, opening the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you like me to sing? You know I haven&rsquo;t sung a note for many
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was well aware of it, but he <i>did</i> want a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down before the piano and began to play. It was a squeaking
      instrument that reminded one of the rattling of loose teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I sing?&rdquo; she asked, turning round on the music-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, darling,&rdquo; he replied, not daring to meet her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your song! Very well, if I can remember it.&rdquo; And she sang: &ldquo;Where is the
      blessed country where my beloved dwells?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But alas! Her voice was thin and shrill and emotion made her sing out of
      tune. At times it sounded like a cry from the bottom of a soul which feels
      that noon is past and evening approaching. The fingers which had done hard
      work strayed on the wrong keys. The instrument, too, had seen its best
      days; the cloth on the hammers had worn away; it sounded as if the springs
      touched the bare wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished her song, she sat for a while without turning round,
      as if she expected him to come and speak to her. But he didn&rsquo;t move; not a
      sound broke the deep silence. When she turned round at last, she saw him
      sitting on the sofa, his cheeks wet with tears. She felt a strong impulse
      to jump up, take his head between her hands and kiss him as she had done
      in days gone by, but she remained where she was, immovable, with downcast
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held a cigar between his thumb and first finger. When the song was
      finished, he bit off the end and struck a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Lily,&rdquo; he said, puffing at his cigar, &ldquo;will you have your
      coffee now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drank their coffee, talked of summer holidays in general and
      suggested two or three places where they might go next summer. But their
      conversation languished and they repeated themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he yawned openly and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, too,&rdquo; she said, getting up. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll get a breath of fresh
      air first, on the balcony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the bed-room. She lingered for a few moments in the
      dining-room, and then talked to the landlady for about half an hour of
      spring-onions and woollen underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the landlady had left her she went into the bedroom and stood for a
      few minutes at the door, listening. No sound came from within. His boots
      stood in the corridor. She opened the door gently and went in. He was
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast on the following morning he had a headache, and she fidgeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What horrible coffee,&rdquo; he said, with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brazilian,&rdquo; she said, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do to-day?&rdquo; he asked, looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better eat some bread and butter, instead of grumbling at the
      coffee?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have a liqueur at the same
      time. That champagne last night, ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked for bread and butter and a liqueur and his temper improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the Pilot&rsquo;s Hill and look at the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose from the breakfast table and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was splendid and the walk did them good. But they walked
      slowly; she panted, and his knees were stiff; they drew no more parallels
      with the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked across the fields. The grass had been cut long ago, there
      wasn&rsquo;t a single flower anywhere. They sat down on some large stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked of the Board of Prisons and his office. She talked of the
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they walked on in silence. He looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hours yet till dinner time,&rdquo; he said. And he wondered how they
      could kill time on the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the hotel. He asked for the papers. She sat down by the
      side of him with a smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked little during dinner. After dinner she mentioned the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, leave the servants alone!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we haven&rsquo;t come here to quarrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I quarrelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An awkward pause followed. He wished somebody would come. The children!
      Yes! This tête-à-tête embarrassed him, but he felt a pain in his heart
      when he thought of the bright hours of yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Oak Hill,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and gather wild strawberries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no wild strawberries at this time of the year, it&rsquo;s autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went. But conversation was difficult. His eyes searched for some
      object on the roadside which would serve for a peg on which to hang a
      remark, but there was nothing. There was no subject which they hadn&rsquo;t
      discussed. She knew all his views on everything and disagreed with most of
      them. She longed to go home, to the children, to her own fireside. She
      found it absurd to make a spectacle of herself in this place and be on the
      verge of a quarrel with her husband all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while they stopped, for they were tired. He sat down and began to
      write in the sand with his walking stick. He hoped she would provoke a
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he replied, feeling as if a burden were falling off his shoulders, &ldquo;I
      am thinking that we are getting old, mother: our innings are over, and we
      have to be content with what has been. If you are of the same mind, we&rsquo;ll
      go home by the night boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought so all along, old man, but I wanted to please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come along, we&rsquo;ll go home. It&rsquo;s no longer summer, autumn is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the hotel, much relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little embarrassed on account of the prosaic ending of the
      adventure, and felt an irresistible longing to justify it from a
      philosophical standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my lo&mdash;h&rsquo;m&rdquo; (the word was too strong)
      &ldquo;my affection for you has undergone a change in the course of time. It has
      developed, broadened; at first it was centred on the individual, but later
      on, on the family as a whole. It is not now you, personally, that I love,
      nor is it the children, but it is the whole....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as my uncle used to say, children are lightning conductors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After his philosophical explanation he became his old self again. It was
      pleasant to take off his frock coat; he felt, as if he were getting into
      his dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the hotel, she began at once to pack, and there she was
      in her element.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went downstairs into the saloon as soon as they got on board. For
      appearance sake, however, he asked her whether she would like to watch the
      sunset; but she declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper he helped himself first, and she asked the waitress the price of
      black bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his supper, he remained sitting at the table,
      lingering over a glass of porter. A thought which had amused him for some
      time, would no longer be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old fool, what?&rdquo; he said, lifting his glass and smiling at his wife who
      happened to look at him at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not return his smile but her eyes, which had flashed for a second,
      assumed so withering an expression of dignity that he felt crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell was broken, the last trace of his old love had vanished; he was
      sitting opposite the mother of his children; he felt small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to look down upon me because I have made a fool of myself for a
      moment,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;But in a man&rsquo;s love there is always a good
      deal of contempt; it is strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the love of a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even more, it is true! But then, she has every cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing&mdash;with a difference. Probably both of them are
      wrong. That which one values too highly, because it is difficult of
      attainment, is easily underrated when one has obtained it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does one value it too highly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it so difficult of attainment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steam whistle above their heads interrupted their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had arrived home, and he saw her again among her children, he
      realised that his affection for her had undergone a change, and that her
      affection for him had been transferred to and divided amongst all these
      little screamers. Perhaps her love for him had only been a means to an
      end. His part had been a short one, and he felt deposed. If he had not
      been required to earn bread and butter, he would probably have been cast
      off long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his study, put on his dressing-gown and slippers, lighted his
      pipe and felt at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the wind lashed the rain against the window panes, and whistled in
      the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the children had been put to bed, his wife came and sat by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No weather to gather wild strawberries,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, the summer is over and autumn is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is autumn,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but it is not yet winter, there is
      comfort in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very poor comfort if we consider that we live but once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice when one has children; three times if one lives to see one&rsquo;s
      grandchildren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after that, the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless there is a life after death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot be sure of that! Who knows? I believe it, but my faith is no
      proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is good to believe it. Let us have faith! Let us believe that
      spring will come again! Let us believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us believe it,&rdquo; he said, gathering her to his breast.

    <h2>
      COMPULSORY MARRIAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      His father died early and from that time forth he was in the hands of a
      mother, two sisters and several aunts. He had no brother. They lived on an
      estate in the Swedish province, Soedermanland, and had no neighbours with
      whom they <i>could be</i> on friendly terms. When he was seven years old,
      a governess was engaged to teach him and his sisters, and about the same
      time a girl cousin came to live with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shared his sisters&rsquo; bedroom, played their games and went bathing with
      them; nobody looked upon him as a member of the other sex. Before long his
      sisters took him in hand and became his schoolmasters and tyrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a strong boy to start with, but left to the mercy of so many doting
      women, he gradually became a helpless molly-coddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he made an attempt to emancipate himself and went to play with the
      boys of the cottagers. They spent the day in the woods, climbed the trees,
      robbed the birds&rsquo; nests and threw stones at the squirrels. Frithiof was as
      happy as a released prisoner, and did not come home to dinner. The boys
      gathered whortle-berries, and bathed in the lake. It was the first really
      enjoyable day of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home in the evening, he found the whole house in great
      commotion. His mother though anxious and upset, did not conceal her joy at
      his return; Aunt Agatha, however, a spinster, and his mother&rsquo;s eldest
      sister, who ruled the house, was furious. She maintained that it would be
      a positive crime not to punish him. Frithiof could not understand why it
      should be a crime, but his aunt told him that disobedience was a sin. He
      protested that he had never been forbidden to play with the children of
      the cottagers. She admitted it but said that, of course, there could never
      have been two questions about it. And she remained firm, and regardless of
      his mother&rsquo;s pleading eyes, took him away to give him a whipping in her
      own room. He was eight years old and fairly big for his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the aunt touched his waist-belt to unbutton his knickers, a cold
      shiver ran down his back; he gasped and his heart thumped against his
      ribs. He made no sound, but stared, horror-struck, at the old woman who
      asked him, almost caressingly, to be obedient and not to offer any
      resistance. But when she laid hands on his shirt, he grew hot with shame
      and fury. He sprang from the sofa on which she had pushed him, hitting out
      right and left. Something unclean, something dark and repulsive, seemed to
      emanate from this woman, and the shame of his sex rose up in him as
      against an assailant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the aunt, mad with passion, seized him, threw him on a chair and beat
      him. He screamed with rage, pain he did not feel, and with convulsive
      kicks tried to release himself; but all of a sudden he lay still and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old woman let him go, he remained where he was, motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she said, in a broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and looked at her. One of her cheeks was pale, the other
      crimson. Her eyes glowed strangely and she trembled all over. He looked at
      her curiously, as one might examine a wild beast, and all of a sudden a
      supercilious smile raised his upper lip; it seemed to him as if his
      contempt gave him an advantage over her. &ldquo;She-devil!&rdquo; He flung the word,
      newly acquired from the children of the cottagers, into her face,
      defiantly and scornfully, seized his clothes and flew downstairs to his
      mother, who was sitting in the dining-room, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to open his heart to her and complain of his aunt&rsquo;s treatment,
      but she had not the courage to comfort him. So he went into the kitchen
      where the maids consoled him with a handful of currants.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day on he was no longer allowed to sleep in the nursery with his
      sisters, but his mother had his bed removed to her own bedroom. He found
      his mother&rsquo;s room stuffy and the new arrangement dull; she frequently
      disturbed his sleep by getting up and coming to his bed in the night to
      see whether he was covered up; then he flew into a rage and answered her
      questions peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was never allowed to go out without being carefully wrapped up by
      someone, and he had so many mufflers that he never knew which one to put
      on. Whenever he tried to steal out of the house, someone was sure to see
      him from the window and call him back to put on an overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by his sisters&rsquo; games began to bore him. His strong arms no longer
      wanted to play battledore and shuttlecock, they longed to throw stones.
      The squabbles over a petty game of croquet, which demanded neither muscle
      nor brain, irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess was another one of his trials. She always spoke to him in
      French and he invariably answered her in Swedish. A vague disgust with his
      whole life and surroundings began to stir in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The free and easy manner in which everybody behaved in his presence
      offended him, and he retaliated by heartily loathing all with whom he came
      in contact. His mother was the only one who considered his feelings to a
      certain extent: she had a big screen put round his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately the kitchen and the servants&rsquo; hall became his refuge; there
      everything he did was approved of. Occasionally, of course, matters were
      discussed there which might have aroused a boy&rsquo;s curiosity, but for him
      there were no secrets. On one occasion, for instance, he had accidentally
      come to the maids&rsquo; bathing-place. The governess, who was with him,
      screamed, he could not understand why, but he stopped and talked to the
      girls who were standing or lying about in the water. Their nudity made no
      impression upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew up into a youth. An inspector was engaged to teach him farming for
      he was, of course, to take over the management of the estate in due time.
      They chose an old man who held the orthodox faith. The old man&rsquo;s society
      was not exactly calculated to stimulate a young man&rsquo;s brain, but it was an
      improvement on the old conditions. It opened new points of view to him and
      roused him to activity. But the inspector received daily and hourly so
      many instructions from the ladies, that he ended by being nothing but
      their mouth-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of fifteen Frithiof was confirmed, received a present of a gold
      watch and was allowed to go out on horseback; he was not permitted,
      however, to realise his greatest ambition, namely to go shooting. True,
      there was no longer any fear of a whipping from his arch-enemy, but he
      dreaded his mother&rsquo;s tears. He always remained a child, and never managed
      to throw off the habit of giving way to the judgment of other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years passed; he had attained his twentieth year. One day he was
      standing in the kitchen watching the cook, who was busy scaling a perch.
      She was a pretty young woman with a delicate complexion. He was teasing
      her and finally put his hand down her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do behave yourself, now, Mr. Frithiof,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am behaving myself,&rdquo; he replied, becoming more and more familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mistress should see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well supposing she did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment his mother passed the open kitchen door; she instantly
      turned away and walked across the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof found the situation awkward and slunk away to his bed-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new gardener entered their service. In their wisdom, anxious to avoid
      trouble with the maids, the ladies had chosen a married man. But, as
      misfortune would have it, the gardener had been married long enough to be
      the father of an exceedingly pretty young daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof quickly discovered the sweet blossom among the other roses in the
      garden, and poured out all the good-will which lay stored up in his heart
      for <i>that</i> half of humanity to which he did not belong, on this young
      girl, who was rather well developed and not without education.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent a good deal of his time in the garden and stopped to talk to her
      whenever he found her working at one of the flower-beds or cutting
      flowers. She did not respond to his advances, but this only had the effect
      of stimulating his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he was riding through the wood, haunted, as usual, by visions of
      her loveliness which, in his opinion, reached the very pinnacle of
      perfection. He was sick with longing to meet her alone, freed from all
      fear of incurring some watcher&rsquo;s displeasure. In his heated imagination
      the desire of being near her had assumed such enormous proportions, that
      he felt that life without her would be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the reins loosely in his hand, and the horse picked his way
      leisurely while its rider sat on its back wrapped in deep thought. All of
      a sudden something light appeared between the trees and the gardener&rsquo;s
      daughter emerged from the underwood and stepped out on the footpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof dismounted and took off his hat. They walked on, side by side,
      talking, while he dragged his horse behind him. He spoke in vague words of
      his love for her; but she rejected all his advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we talk of the impossible?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is impossible?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That a wealthy gentleman like you should marry a poor girl like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no denying the aptitude of her remark, and Frithiof felt that he
      was worsted. His love for her was boundless, but he could see no
      possibility of bringing his doe safely through the pack which guarded
      house and home; they would tear her to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this conversation he gave himself up to mute despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn the gardener gave notice and left the estate without giving
      a reason. For six weeks Frithiof was inconsolable, for he had lost his
      first and only love; he would never love again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the autumn slowly passed and winter stood before the door. At
      Christmas a new officer of health came into the neighbourhood. He had
      grown-up children, and as the aunts were always ill, friendly relations
      were soon established between the two families. Among the doctor&rsquo;s
      children was a young girl and before long Frithiof was head over ears in
      love with her. He was at first ashamed of his infidelity to his first
      love, but he soon came to the conclusion that love was something
      impersonal, because it was possible to change the object of one&rsquo;s
      tenderness; it was almost like a power of attorney made out on the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as his guardians got wind of this new attachment, the mother asked
      her son for a private interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have now arrived at that age,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;when a man begins to look
      out for a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already done that, my dear mother,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been too hasty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The girl of whom, I
      suppose, you are thinking, doesn&rsquo;t possess the moral principles which an
      educated man should demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Amy&rsquo;s moral principles! Who has anything to say against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say a word against the girl herself, but her father, as you know,
      is a freethinker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be proud to be related to a man who can think freely, without
      considering his material interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s leave him out of the question; you are forgetting, my dear
      Frithiof, that you are already bound elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Do you mean....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you have played with Louisa&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking of cousin Louisa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Haven&rsquo;t you looked upon yourselves as fiancés since your earliest
      childhood? Don&rsquo;t you realise that she has put all her faith and trust in
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who have played with us, driven us together, not I!&rdquo; answered
      the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of your old mother, think of your sisters, Frithiof. Do you want to
      bring a stranger into this house which has always been our home, a
      stranger who will have the right to order us about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I see; Louisa is the chosen mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chosen mistress, but a mother always has a right to choose the
      future wife of her son; nobody is so well fitted to undertake such a task.
      Do you doubt my good faith? Can you possibly suspect me, your mother, of a
      wish to injure you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! but I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t love Louisa; I like her as a sister, but....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love? Nothing in all the world is so inconstant as love! It&rsquo;s folly to
      rely on it, it passes away like a breath; but friendship, conformity of
      views and habits, similar interests and a long acquaintanceship, these are
      the surest guarantees of a happy marriage. Louisa is a capable girl,
      domesticated and methodical, she will make your home as happy as you could
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof&rsquo;s only way of escape was to beg his mother for time to consider
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile all the ladies of the household had recovered their health, so
      that the doctor was no longer required. Still he called one day, but he
      was treated like a burglar who had come to spy out the land. He was a
      sharp man and saw at once how matters stood. Frithiof returned his call
      but was received coldly. This was the end of their friendly relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof came of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantic attempts were now made to carry the fortress by storm. The aunts
      cringed before the new master and tried to prove to him that they could
      not be dispensed with, by treating him as if he were a child. His sisters
      mothered him more than ever, and Louisa began to devote a great deal of
      attention to her dress. She laced herself tightly and curled her hair. She
      was by no means a plain girl, but she had cold eyes and a sharp tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof remained indifferent; as far as he was concerned she was sexless;
      he had never looked at her with the eyes of a man. But now, after the
      conversation with his mother, he could not help a certain feeling of
      embarrassment in her presence, especially as she seemed to seek his
      society. He met her everywhere; on the stairs, in the garden, in the
      stables even. One morning, when he was still in bed, she came into his
      room to ask him for a pin; she was wearing a dressing-jacket and pretended
      to be very shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a dislike to her, but nevertheless she was always in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the mother had one conversation after another with her
      son, and aunt and sisters never ceased hinting at the anticipated wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was made a burden to him. He saw no way of escape from the net in
      which he had been caught. Louisa was no longer his sister and friend,
      though he did not like her any the better for it; his constant dwelling on
      the thought of marrying her had had the result of making him realise that
      she was a woman, an unsympathetic woman, it was true, but still a woman.
      His marriage would mean a change in his position, and, perhaps, delivery
      from bondage. There were no other girls in the neighbourhood, and, after
      all, she was probably as good as any other young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went one day to his mother and told her that he had made up his
      mind. He would marry Louisa on condition that he should have an
      establishment of his own in one of the wings of the house, and his own
      table. He also insisted that his mother should propose for him, for he
      could not bring himself to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compromise was accepted and Louisa was called in to receive Frithiof&rsquo;s
      embrace and timid kiss. They both wept for reasons which neither of them
      understood. They felt ashamed of themselves for the rest of the day.
      Afterwards everything went on as before, but the motherliness of aunts and
      sisters knew no bounds. They furnished the wing, arranged the rooms,
      settled everything; Frithiof was never consulted in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for the wedding were completed. Old friends, buried in
      the provinces, were hunted up and invited to be present at the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after his wedding day Frithiof was up early. He left his
      bed-room as quickly as possible, pretending that his presence was
      necessary in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisa, who was still sleepy, made no objection. But as he was going out
      she called after him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget breakfast at eleven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It sounded like a command.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his den, put on a shooting coat and waterproof boots and took
      his gun, which he kept concealed in his wardrobe. Then he went out into
      the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful October morning. Everything was covered with hoar
      frost. He walked quickly as if he were afraid of being called back, or as
      if he were trying to escape from something. The fresh air had the effect
      of a bath. He felt a free man, at last, and he used his freedom to go out
      for a morning stroll with his gun. But this exhilarating feeling of bodily
      freedom soon passed. Up to now he had at least had a bedroom of his own.
      He had been master of his thoughts during the day and his dreams at night.
      That was over. The thought of that common bedroom tormented him; there was
      something unclean about it. Shame was cast aside like a mask, all delicacy
      of feeling was dispensed with, every illusion of the &ldquo;high origin&rdquo; of man
      destroyed; to come into such close contact with nothing but the beast in
      man had been too much for him, for he had been brought up by idealists. He
      was staggered by the enormity of the hypocrisy displayed in the
      intercourse between men and women; it was a revelation to him to find that
      the inmost substance of that indescribable womanliness was nothing but the
      fear of consequences. But supposing he had married the doctor&rsquo;s daughter,
      or the gardener&rsquo;s little girl? Then to be alone with her would be bliss,
      while to be alone with his wife was depressing and unlovely; then the
      coarse desire to satisfy a curiosity and a want would be transformed into
      an ecstasy more spiritual than carnal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered through the wood without a purpose, without an idea of what he
      wanted to shoot; be only felt a vague desire to hear a shot and to kill
      something; but nothing came before his gun. The birds had already
      migrated. Only a squirrel was climbing about the branches of a pine-tree,
      staring at him with brilliant eyes. He raised the gun and pulled the
      trigger; but the nimble little beast was already on the other side of the
      trunk when the shot hit the tree. But the sound impressed his nerves
      pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the footpath and went through the undergrowth. He stamped on every
      fungus that grew on his way. He was in a destructive mood. He looked for a
      snake so as to trample on it or kill it with a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he remembered that he ought to go home and that it was the
      morning after his wedding day. The mere thought of the curious glances to
      which he would be exposed had the effect of making him feel like a
      criminal, about to be unmasked and shown up for having committed a crime
      against good manners and, what was worse, against nature. Oh! that he
      could have left this world behind him! But how was he to do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts grew tired at last of revolving round and round the same
      problem and he felt a craving for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to return home and have some breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the gate which led to the court yard, he saw the whole
      house-party standing before the entrance hall. As soon as they caught
      sight of him they began to cheer. He crossed the yard with uncertain
      footsteps and listened with ill-concealed irritation to the sly questions
      after his health. Then he turned away and went into the house, never
      noticing his wife, who was standing amongst the group waiting for him to
      go up to her and kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the breakfast table he suffered tortures; tortures which he knew would
      be burnt into his memory for all times. The insinuations of his guests
      offended him and his wife&rsquo;s caresses stung him. His day of rejoicing was
      the most miserable day of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a few months the young wife, with the assistance of aunts
      and sisters, had established her over-rule in the house. Frithiof
      remained, what he had always been, the youngest and dullest member of the
      household. His advice was sometimes asked for, but never acted upon; he
      was looked after as if he were still a child. His wife soon found it
      unbearable to dine with him alone, for he kept an obstinate silence during
      the meal. Louisa could not stand it; she must have a lightning conductor;
      one of the sisters removed into the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frithiof made more than one attempt to emancipate himself, but his
      attempts were always frustrated by the enemy; they were too many for him,
      and they talked and preached until he fled into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evenings held terror for him. He hated the bedroom, and went to it as
      to a place of execution. He became morose and avoided everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been married for a year now, and still there was no promise of a
      child; his mother took him aside one day to have a talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have a son?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I would,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t treating your wife very kindly,&rdquo; said the mother as gently as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What do you say? Are you finding fault with me? Do you want me to
      toil all day long? H&rsquo;m! You don&rsquo;t know Louisa! But whose business is it
      but mine? Bring your charge against me in such a way that I can answer
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the mother was not disposed to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonely and miserable, he made friends with the inspector, a young man,
      addicted to wine and cards. He sought his company and spent the evenings
      in his room; he went to bed late, as late as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming home one night, he found his wife still awake and waiting for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be married and have no husband is anything but pleasant,&rdquo; she
      rejoined. &ldquo;If we had a child, at least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my fault that we haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarrel arose as to whose fault it was, and the quarrel lasted for two
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As both of them were too obstinate to take medical advice, the usual thing
      happened. The husband cut a ridiculous figure, and the wife a tragic one.
      He was told that a childless woman was sacred because, for some reason or
      other, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s&rdquo; curse rested on her. That &ldquo;God&rdquo; could also stoop to curse a
      man was beyond the women&rsquo;s comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Frithiof had no doubt that a curse rested on him for his life was
      dreary and unhealthy. Nature has created two sexes, which are now friends,
      now enemies. He had met the enemy, an overwhelming enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a capon?&rdquo; he was asked by one of his sisters one day. She was
      busy with her needlework and asked the question à propos of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her suspiciously. No, she did not know the meaning of the
      word; she had probably listened to a conversation and her curiosity was
      aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the iron had entered his soul. He was being laughed at. He grew
      suspicious. Everything he heard and saw he connected with that charge.
      Beside himself with rage, he seduced one of the maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      His act had the desired result. In due time he was a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Louisa was looked upon as a martyr and he as a blackguard. The abuse
      left him indifferent, for he had vindicated his honour&mdash;if it was an
      honour and not merely a lucky chance to be born without defects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the incident roused Louisa&rsquo;s jealousy and&mdash;it was a strange thing&mdash;awakened
      in her a sort of love for her husband. It was a love which irritated him,
      for it showed itself in unremitting watchfulness and nervous
      obtrusiveness; sometimes even in maternal tenderness and solicitude which
      knew no bounds. She wanted to look after his gun, see whether it was
      charged; she begged him on her knees to wear his overcoat when he went
      out.... She kept his home with scrupulous care, tidied and dusted all day
      long; every Saturday the rooms were turned inside out, the carpets beaten
      and his clothes aired. He had no peace and never knew when he would be
      turned out of his room so that it could be scrubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not sufficient to do to occupy him during the day, for the women
      looked after everything. He studied agriculture and attempted to make
      improvements, but all his efforts were frustrated. He was not master in
      his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he lost heart. He had grown taciturn because he was always
      contradicted. The want of congenial company and fellows-in-misfortune
      gradually dulled his brain; his nerves went to pieces; he neglected his
      appearance and took to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hardly ever at home now. Frequently he could be found, intoxicated,
      at the public house or in the cottages of the farm labourers. He drank
      with everybody and all day long. He stimulated his brain with alcohol for
      the sake of the relief he found in talking. It was difficult to decide
      whether he drank in order to be able to talk to somebody who did not
      contradict him, or whether he drank merely in order to get drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sold privileges and farm produce to the cottagers to provide himself
      with money, for the women held the cash. Finally he burgled his own safe
      and stole the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an orthodox, church-going inspector on the premises now; the
      previous one had been dismissed on account of his intemperate habits. When
      at last, through the clergyman&rsquo;s influence, the proprietor of the inn lost
      his license Frithiof took to drinking with his own farm labourers. Scandal
      followed on scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He developed into a heavy drinker who had epileptic fits whenever he was
      deprived of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ultimately committed to an institution where he remained as an
      incurable patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lucid intervals, when he was capable of surveying his life, his heart
      was filled with compassion for all women who are compelled to marry
      without love; his compassion was all the deeper because he had suffered in
      his own flesh the curse which lies on every violation of nature; and yet
      he was only a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the cause of his unhappiness in the family&mdash;the family as a
      social institution, which does not permit the child to become an
      independent individual at the proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought no charge against his wife, for was she not equally unhappy, a
      victim of the same unfortunate conditions which are honoured by the sacred
      name of Law?

    <h2>
      CORINNA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her father was a general, her mother died when she was still a baby. After
      her mother&rsquo;s death few ladies visited the house; the callers were mostly
      men. And her father took her education into his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out riding with him, was present at the manoeuvres, took an
      interest in gymnastics and attended the musters of the reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her father occupied the highest rank in their circle of friends,
      everybody treated him with an amount of respect which is rarely shown to
      equals, and as she was the general&rsquo;s daughter, she was treated in the same
      way. She held the rank of a general and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was always an orderly sitting in the hall who rose with much
      clanking and clashing of steel and stood at attention whenever she went in
      or out. At the balls none but the majors dared to ask her for a dance; she
      looked upon a captain as a representative of an inferior race, and a
      lieutenant as a naughty boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell into the habit of appreciating people entirely according to their
      rank. She called all civilians &ldquo;fishes,&rdquo; poorly-clad people &ldquo;rascals,&rdquo; and
      the very poor &ldquo;the mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, however, were altogether outside this scale. Her father, who
      occupied a position above all men, and who was saluted respectfully
      wherever he went, always stood up before a lady, regardless of her age,
      kissed the hands of those he knew, and was at the beck and call of every
      pretty woman. The result of this was that very early in life she became
      very firmly convinced of the superiority of her own sex, and accustomed
      herself to look upon a man as a lower being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever she went out on horseback, a groom invariably rode behind her.
      When she stopped to admire the landscape, he stopped too. He was her
      shadow. But she had no idea what he looked like, or whether he was young
      or old. If she had been asked about his sex, she would not have known how
      to reply; it had never occurred to her that the shadow could have a sex;
      when, in mounting, she placed her little riding-boot in his hand, she
      remained quite indifferent, and even occasionally raised her habit a
      little as if nobody were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inbred conceptions of the surpassing importance of rank influenced
      her whole life. She found it impossible to make friends with the daughters
      of a major or a captain, because their fathers were her father&rsquo;s social
      inferiors. Once a lieutenant asked her for a dance. To punish him for his
      impudence, she refused to talk to him in the intervals. But when she heard
      later on that her partner had been one of the royal princes, she was
      inconsolable. She who knew every order and title, and the rank of every
      officer, had failed to recognise a prince! It was too terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beautiful, but pride gave her features a certain rigidity which
      scared her admirers away. The thought of marriage had never occurred to
      her. The young men were not fully qualified, and those to whose social
      position there was no objection, were too old. If she, the daughter of a
      general, had married a captain, then a major&rsquo;s wife would have taken
      precedence of her. Such a degradation would have killed her. Moreover, she
      had no wish to be a man&rsquo;s chattel, or an ornament for his drawing-room.
      She was accustomed to command, accustomed to be obeyed; she could obey no
      man. The freedom and independence of a man&rsquo;s life appealed to her; it had
      fostered in her a loathing for all womanly occupations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sexual instinct awoke late. As she belonged to an old family which on
      her father&rsquo;s side, had squandered its strength in a soulless militarism,
      drink and dissipation, and on her mother&rsquo;s had suppressed fertility to
      prevent the splitting up of property, Nature seemed to have hesitated
      about her sex at the eleventh hour; or perhaps had lacked strength to
      determine on the continuation of the race. Her figure possessed none of
      those essentially feminine characteristics, which Nature requires for her
      purposes, and she scorned to hide her defects by artificial means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few women friends she had, found her cold and indifferent towards
      everything connected with the sex problem. She treated it with contempt,
      considered the relationship between the sexes disgusting, and could not
      understand how a woman could give herself to a man. In her opinion Nature
      was unclean; to wear clean underlinen, starched petticoats and stockings
      without holes was to be virtuous; poor was merely another term for dirt
      and vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every summer she spent with her father on their estate in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was no great lover of the country. Nature made her feel small; she
      found the woods uncanny, the lake made her shudder, there was danger
      hidden in the tall meadow-grass. She regarded the peasants as cunning and
      rather filthy beasts. They had so many children, and she had no doubt that
      both boys and girls were full of vice. Nevertheless they were always
      invited to the manor house on Midsummer day and on the general&rsquo;s birthday,
      to play the part of the chorus of grand opera, that is to say, to cheer
      and dance, and look like the figures in a painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was springtime. Helena, on her thoroughbred mare, had penetrated into
      the depths of the country. She felt tired and dismounted; she fastened her
      mare to a birchtree which grew near an enclosure. Then she strolled along
      by the side of a ditch and began to gather wild orchids. The air was soft
      and balmy, steam was rising from the ground. She could hear the frogs
      jumping into the ditch which was half-full of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the mare neighed and, stretching her slender neck over the
      fence, drew in the air with wide-open nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;be quiet, old girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she continued to gather the modest flowers which so cleverly hide
      their secrets behind the prettiest and neatest curtains that for all the
      world look like printed calico.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mare neighed again. From behind the hazel bushes on the other side
      of the enclosure came an answer, a second neighing, deeper and fuller. The
      swampy ground of the enclosure shook, powerful hoofs scattered the stones,
      to right and left and a black stallion appeared at full gallop. The tense
      neck carried a magnificent head, the muscles lay like ropes under the
      glossy skin. As he caught sight of the mare, his eyes began to flash. He
      stopped and stretched out his neck as if he were going to yawn, raised his
      upper lip and showed his teeth. Then he galloped across the grass and
      approached the railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena picked up her skirt and ran to her mare; she raised her hand to
      seize the bridle, but the mare broke away and took the fence. Then the
      wooing began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the fence and called, but the excited mare paid no heed.
      Inside the enclosure the horses chased one another; the situation was a
      critical one. The breath of the stallion came like smoke from his nostrils
      and white foam flecked his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena longed to escape, for the scene filled her with horror. She had
      never witnessed the raging of a natural instinct in a living body. This
      uncontrolled outbreak terrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to run after her mare and drag her away by force, but she was
      afraid of the savage stallion. She wanted to call for help, but she was
      loath to attract other eyewitnesses. She turned her back to the scene and
      decided to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs came from the direction of the highroad; a
      carriage appeared in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no escape; although she was ashamed to stay where she was, it
      was too late now to run away, for the horses were slowing down and the
      carriage stopped a few yards in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the occupants of the carriage, a lady,
      and raised her golden lorgnette so as to get a better view of the
      spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are we stopping?&rdquo; retorted the other, irritably. &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it beautiful?&rdquo; asked the elder lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman&rsquo;s smile was lost in his great beard, as he urged the horses
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are such a prude, my dear Milly,&rdquo; said the first voice. &ldquo;To me this
      kind of thing is like a thunderstorm, or a heavy sea....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena could hear no more. She felt crushed with vexation, shame and
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      A farm labourer came shuffling along the highroad. Helena ran to meet him,
      so as to prevent him from witnessing the scene, and at the same time ask
      his help. But he was already too near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the miller&rsquo;s black stallion,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;In that
      case it will be better to wait until it&rsquo;s all over, for he won&rsquo;t brook
      interference. If the lady will leave it to me, I will bring her mare home
      later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad to have done with the matter, Helena hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she arrived home, she was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She refused to ride her mare again, for in her eyes the beast had become
      unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pretty adventure had a greater influence on Helena&rsquo;s psychic
      development than might have been expected. The brutal outbreak of a
      natural instinct, the undisguised exhibition of which in the community of
      men is punished with a term of imprisonment, haunted her as if she had
      been present at an execution. It distressed her during the day and
      disturbed her dreams at night. It increased her fear of nature and made
      her give up her former amazon&rsquo;s life. She remained at home and gave
      herself up to study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house boasted a library. But as misfortune would have it, no additions
      had been made since her grandfather&rsquo;s death. All books were therefore a
      generation too old, and Helena found antiquated ideals. The first book
      which fell into her hands was Madame de Staël&rsquo;s <i>Corinna</i> The way in
      which the volume lay on the shelf indicated that it had served a special
      purpose. Bound in green and gold, a little shabby at the edges, full of
      marginal notes and underlined passages, the work of her late mother, it
      became a bridge, as it were, between mother and daughter, which enabled
      the now grown-up daughter to make the acquaintance of the dead mother.
      These pencil notes were the story of a soul. Displeasure with the prose of
      life and the brutality of nature, had inflamed the writer&rsquo;s imagination
      and inspired it to construct a dreamworld in which the souls dwelled,
      disincarnate. It was essentially an aristocratic world, this dreamworld,
      for it required financial independence from its denizens, so that the soul
      might be fed with thoughts. This brain-fever, called romance, was
      therefore the gospel of the wealthy, and became absurd and pitiful as soon
      as it penetrated to the lower classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinna became Helena&rsquo;s ideal: the divinely inspired poetess who like the
      nun of the middle-ages, had vowed a vow of chastity, so that she might
      lead a life of purity, who was, of course, admired by a brilliant throng,
      rose to immeasurable heights above the heads of the petty every-day
      mortals. It was the old ideal all over again, transposed: salutes,
      standing at attention, rolling of drums, the first place everywhere.
      Helena was quite ignorant of the fact that Madame de Staël outlived the
      Corinna ideal, and did not become a real influence until she came out of
      her dreamworld into the world of facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased to take an interest in everyday affairs, she communed with
      herself and brooded over her ego. The inheritance which her mother had
      left her in posthumous notes began to germinate. She identified herself
      with both Corinna and her mother, and spent much time in meditating on her
      mission in life. That nature had intended her to become a mother and do
      her share in the propagation of the human race, she refused to admit her
      mission was to explain to humanity what Madame de Staël&rsquo;s Corinna had
      thought fifty years ago; but she imagined the thoughts were her own,
      striving to find expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to write. One day she attempted verse. She succeeded. The lines
      were of equal length and the last words rhymed. A great light dawned on
      her: she was a poetess. One thing more remained: she wanted ideas; well
      she could take them from <i>Corinna</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way quite a number of poems originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had also to be bestowed on the world, and this could not be done
      unless they were printed. One day she sent a poem entitled <i>Sappho</i>
      and signed <i>Corinna</i> to the <i>Illustrated Newspaper</i>. With a
      beating heart she went out to post the letter herself, and as it dropped
      into the pillarbox, she prayed softly to &ldquo;God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A trying fortnight ensued. She ate nothing, hardly closed her eyes, and
      spent her days in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Saturday came and the paper was delivered, she trembled as if she
      were fever-stricken, and when she found that her verses were neither
      printed nor mentioned in &ldquo;Letters to Correspondents,&rdquo; she almost broke
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Saturday, when she could count on an answer with some
      certainty, she slipped the paper into her pocket without unfolding it, and
      went into the woods. When she had arrived at a secluded spot and made sure
      that no one was watching her, she unfolded the paper and hastily glanced
      at the contents. One poem only was printed, entitled <i>Bellman&rsquo;s-day</i>.
      She turned to &ldquo;Letters to Correspondents.&rdquo; Her first glance at the small
      print made her start violently. Her fingers clutched the paper, rolled it
      into a ball and flung it into the underwood. Then she stared, fascinated,
      at the ball of white, glimmering through the green undergrowth. For the
      first time in her life she had received an insult. She was completely
      unnerved. This unknown journalist had dared what nobody had dared before:
      he had been rude to her. She had come out from behind her trenches into
      the arena where high birth counts for nothing, but where victory belongs
      to that wonderful natural endowment which we call talent, and before which
      all powers bow when it can no longer be denied. But the unknown had also
      offended the woman in her, for he had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Corinna of 1807 would have cooked dinners and rocked cradles if she
      had lived after 1870. But you are no Corinna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she had heard the voice of the enemy, the arch-enemy,
      man. Cook dinners and rock cradles! They should see!
    </p>
    <p>
      She went home. She felt so crushed that her muscles hardly obeyed her
      relaxed nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone a little way, she suddenly turned round and retraced her
      footsteps. Supposing anybody found that paper! It would give her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the spot, and breaking off a hazel switch, dragged the
      paper out from where it lay and carefully smoothed it. Then she raised a
      piece of turf, hid the paper underneath and rolled a stone on the top. It
      was a hope that lay buried there, and also a proof&mdash;of what? That she
      had committed a crime? She felt that she had. She had done a wrong, she
      had shown herself naked before the other sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day on a struggle went on in her heart. Ambition and fear of
      publicity strove within her, and she was unable to come to a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following autumn her father died. As he had been addicted to
      gambling, and more often lost than won, he left debts behind him. But in
      smart society these things are of no account. There was no necessity for
      Helena to earn her living in a shop, for a hitherto unknown aunt came
      forward and offered her a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her father&rsquo;s death wrought a complete change in her position. No more
      salutes; the officers of the regiment nodded to her in a friendly fashion,
      the lieutenants asked her to dance. She saw plainly that the respect shown
      to her had not been shown to her personally, but merely to her rank. She
      felt degraded and a lively sympathy for all subalterns was born in her;
      she even felt a sort of hatred for all those who enjoyed her former
      privileges. Side by side with this feeling grew up a yearning for personal
      appreciation, a desire to win a position surpassing all others, although
      it might not figure in the Army list.
    </p>
    <p>
      She longed to distinguish herself, to win fame, and, (why not?) to rule.
      She possessed one talent which she had cultivated to some extent, although
      she had never risen above the average; she played the piano. She began to
      study harmony and talked of the sonata in G minor and the symphony in F
      major as if she had written them herself. And forthwith she began to
      patronise musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months after her father&rsquo;s death, the post of a lady-in-waiting was
      offered to her. She accepted it. The rolling of drums and military salutes
      recommenced, and Helena gradually lost her sympathy with subalterns. But
      the mind is as inconstant as fortune, and fresh experiences again brought
      about a change of her views.
    </p>
    <p>
      She discovered one day, and the day was not long in coming, that she was
      nothing but a servant. She was sitting in the Park with the Duchess. The
      Duchess was crocheting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider those blue stockings perfectly idiotic,&rdquo; said the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena turned pale; she stared at her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask your opinion,&rdquo; replied the Duchess, letting her ball of wool
      roll into the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena&rsquo;s knees trembled; her future, her position passed away before her
      eyes like a flash of lightning. She went to pick up the wool. It seemed to
      her that her back was breaking as she stooped, and her cheeks flamed when
      the Duchess took the ball without a word of thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry?&rdquo; asked the Duchess, staring impertinently at her
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Your Royal Highness,&rdquo; was Helena&rsquo;s untruthful reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that you are a blue-stocking yourself,&rdquo; continued the Duchess.
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena had a feeling as if she were standing nude before her tormentor and
      made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time the ball rolled into the dust. Helena pretended not to
      notice it, and bit her lips to hold back the angry tears which were
      welling up in her eyes. &ldquo;Pick up my wool, please,&rdquo; said the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena drew herself up, looked the autocrat full in the face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words she turned and fled. The sand gritted under her feet,
      and little clouds of dust followed in the wake of her train. She almost
      ran down the stone steps and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her career at court was ended; but a sting remained. Helena was made to
      feel what it means to be in disgrace, and above all things what it means
      to throw up one&rsquo;s post. Society does not approve of changes and nobody
      would believe that she had voluntarily renounced the sunshine of the
      court. No doubt she had been sent away. Yes, it must be so, she had been
      sent away. Never before had she felt so humiliated, so insulted. It seemed
      to her that she had lost caste; her relations treated her with coldness,
      as if they were afraid that her disgrace might be infectious; her former
      friends gave her the cold shoulder when they met her, and limited their
      conversation to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, as she stooped from her former height, the
      middle-classes received her with open arms. It was true, at first their
      friendliness offended her more than the coldness of her own class, but in
      the end she preferred being first down below to being last up above. She
      joined a group of Government officials and professors who hailed her with
      acclamations. Animated by the superstitious awe with which the middle
      classes regard everybody connected with the court, they at once began to
      pay her homage. She became their chosen leader and hastened to form a
      regiment. A number of young professors enlisted at once and she arranged
      lectures for women. Old academic rubbish was brought out from the
      lumber-room, dusted and sold for new wares. In a dining-room, denuded of
      its furniture, lectures on Plato and Aristotle were given to an audience
      which unfortunately held no key to this shrine of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena, in conquering these pseudo-mysteries felt the intellectual
      superior of the ignorant aristocracy. This feeling gave her an assurance
      which impressed people. The men worshipped her beauty and aloofness; but
      she never felt in the least moved in their company. She accepted their
      homage as a tribute due to women and found it impossible to respect these
      lackeys who jumped up and stood at attention whenever she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the long run her position as an unmarried woman failed to satisfy
      her, and she noted with envious eyes the freedom enjoyed by her married
      sisters. They were at liberty to go wherever they liked, talk to whom they
      liked, and always had a footman in their husband to meet them and
      accompany them on their way home. In addition, married women had a better
      social position, and a great deal more influence. With what condescension
      for instance, they treated the spinsters! But whenever she thought of
      getting married, the incident with her mare flashed into her mind and
      terror made her ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second year the wife of a professor from Upsala, who combined with
      her official position great personal charm, appeared on the scene.
      Helena&rsquo;s star paled; all her worshippers left her to worship the new sun.
      As she no longer possessed her former social position, and the savour of
      the court had vanished like the scent on a handkerchief, she was beaten in
      the fight. One single vassal remained faithful to her, a lecturer on
      ethics, who had hitherto not dared to push himself forward. His attentions
      were well received, for the severity of his ethics filled her with
      unlimited confidence. He wooed her so assiduously that people began to
      gossip; Helena, however, took no notice, she was above that.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, after a lecture on &ldquo;The Ethical Moment in Conjugal Love&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Marriage as a Manifestation of Absolute Identity,&rdquo; for which the lecturer
      received nothing but his expenses and a grateful pressure of hands, they
      were sitting in the denuded dining-room on their uncomfortable cane
      chairs, discussing the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say then,&rdquo; said Helena, &ldquo;that marriage is a relationship of
      co-existence between two identical Egos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I said already in my lecture, that only if there exists such
      a relationship between two congruous identities, <i>being</i> can conflow
      into <i>becoming</i> of higher potentiality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by <i>becoming?</i>&rdquo; asked Helena, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post-existence of two egos in a new ego.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You mean that the continuity of the ego, which through the
      cohabitation of two analogous beings will necessarily incorporate itself
      into a becoming....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear lady, I only meant to say that marriage, in profane parlance,
      can only produce a new spiritual ego, which cannot be differentiated as to
      sex, when there is compatibility of souls. I mean to say that the new
      being born under those conditions will be a conglomerate of male and
      female; a new creature to whom both will have yielded their personality, a
      unity in multiplicity, to use a well-known term, an <i>&lsquo;hommefemme.&lsquo;</i>
      The man will cease to be man, the woman will cease to be woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the union of souls!&rdquo; exclaimed Helena, glad to have successfullly
      navigated the dangerous cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the harmony of souls of which Plato speaks. It is true marriage as
      I have sometimes visualised it in my dreams, but which, unfortunately, I
      shall hardly be able to realise in actuality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena stared at the ceiling and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you, one of the elect, realise this dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she to whom my soul is drawn with irresistible longing does not
      believe in&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if she did, she would always be tormented by the suspicion that the
      feeling was not sincere. Moreover, there is no woman in the world who
      would fall in love with me, no, not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; said Helena, gazing into his glass eye. (He had a glass
      eye, but it was so well made, it was impossible to detect it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; replied Helena. &ldquo;For you are different to other men. You
      realise what spiritual love means, the love of the souls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if the woman did exist, I could never marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Share a room with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That needn&rsquo;t be the case. Madame de Staël merely lived in the same house
      as her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What interesting topic are you two discussing?&rdquo; asked the professor&rsquo;s
      wife, coming out of the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking of <i>Laocoon</i>,&rdquo; answered Helena, rising, from her
      chair. She was offended by the note of condescension in the lady&rsquo;s voice.
      And she made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later her engagement to the lecturer was publicly announced. They
      decided to be married in the autumn and take up their abode at Upsala.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant banquet, in celebration of the close of his bachelor life, was
      given to the lecturer on ethics. A great deal of wine had been consumed
      and the only artist the town boasted, the professor of drawing at the
      Cathedral School, had depicted in bold outlines the victim&rsquo;s career up to
      date. It was the great feature of the whole entertainment. Ethics was a
      subject of teaching and a milch cow, like many others, and need not
      necessarily influence either the life of the community, or the life of the
      individual. The lecturer had not been a saint, but had had his adventures
      like everybody else; these were public property, for he had had no reason
      to keep them dark. With a careless smile he watched his career, pictured
      in chalk and colours, accompanied by witty verses, unfolding itself before
      his eyes, but when at last his approaching bliss was portrayed in simple
      but powerful sketches, he became deeply embarrassed, and the thought &ldquo;If
      Helena were to see that!&rdquo; flashed like lightning through his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the banquet, at which according to an old, time-honoured custom, he
      had drunk eight glasses of brandy, he was so intoxicated that he could no
      longer suppress his fears and apprehensions. Among his hosts was a married
      man and to him the victim turned for counsel and advice. Since neither of
      them was sober, they chose, as the most secluded spot in the whole room,
      two chairs right in the centre, immediately under the chandelier.
      Consequently they were soon surrounded by an eagerly listening crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! You are a married man,&rdquo; said the lecturer at the top of his
      voice, so as not to be heard by the assembly, as he fondly imagined. &ldquo;You
      must give me a word of advice, just one, only one little word of advice,
      for I am extremely sensitive to-night, especially in regard to this
      particular point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, brother,&rdquo; shouted his friend, &ldquo;just one word, as you say,&rdquo; and he
      put his arm round his shoulders that he might whisper to him; then he
      continued, screaming loudly: &ldquo;Every act consists of three parts, my
      brother: <i>Progresses, culmen, regressus</i>. I will speak to you of the
      first, the second is never mentioned. Well, the initiative, so to speak,
      that is the man&rsquo;s privilege&mdash;your part! You must take the initiative,
      you must attack, do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing the other party does not approve of the initiative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friend stared at the novice, taken aback; then he rose and
      contemptuously turned his back on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; was all the grateful pupil could reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day he was on fire with all the strong drink he had
      consumed; he went and took a hot bath, for on the third day was to be his
      wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding guests had departed; the servant had cleared the table; they
      were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena was comparatively calm, but he felt exceedingly nervous. The period
      of their engagement had been enhanced by conversations on serious
      subjects. They had never behaved liked ordinary, every-day fiancés, had
      never embraced or kissed. Whenever he had attempted the smallest
      familiarity, her cold looks had chilled his ardour. But he loved her as a
      man loves a woman, with body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fidgeted about the drawing-room and tried to make conversation. But
      an obstinate silence again and again reasserted itself. The candles in the
      chandelier had burnt low and the wax fell in greasy drops on the carpet.
      The atmosphere was heavy with the smell of food and the fumes of the wines
      which mingled with the voluptuous perfume of carnations and heliotrope,
      exhaled by Helena&rsquo;s bridal bouquet that lay on a side-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he went up to her, held out his arms, and said in a voice which he
      hoped sounded natural:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you are my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; was Helena&rsquo;s brusque reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely taken aback, he allowed his arms to drop to his sides. But he
      pulled himself together again, almost immediately, and said with a
      self-conscious smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that we are husband and wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena looked at him as if she thought that he had taken leave of his
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain your words!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was just what he couldn&rsquo;t do. Philosophy and ethics failed him; he
      was faced by a cold and exceedingly unpleasant reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s modesty,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite right, but I must attack and do
      my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you misunderstood me?&rdquo; asked Helena and her voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not, but, my dear child, h&rsquo;m&mdash;we&mdash;h&rsquo;m....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What language is that? Dear child? What do you take me for? What do you
      mean? Albert, Albert!&rdquo;&mdash;she rushed on without waiting for a reply,
      which she didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;&ldquo;Be great, be noble, and learn to see in women
      something more than sex. Do that, and you will be happy and great!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was beaten. Crushed with shame and furious with his false friend
      who had counselled him wrongly, he threw himself on his knees before her
      and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Helena, you are nobler, purer, better than I; you are made of
      finer fibre and you will lift me up when I threaten to perish in coarse
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arise and be strong, Albert,&rdquo; said Helena, with the manner of a
      prophetess. &ldquo;Go in peace and show to the world that love and base animal
      passion are two very different things. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert rose from his knees and stared irresolutely after his wife who went
      into her room and shut the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of the noblest and purest sentiments he also went into his room. He
      took off his coat and lighted a cigar. His room was furnished like a
      bachelor&rsquo;s room: a bed-sofa, a writing table, some book shelves, a
      washstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had undressed, he dipped a towel into his ewer and rubbed himself
      all over. Then he lay down on his sofa and opened the evening paper. He
      wanted to read while he smoked his cigar. He read an article on
      Protection. His thoughts began to flow in a more normal channel, and he
      considered his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he married or was he still a bachelor? He was a bachelor as before,
      but there was a difference&mdash;he now had a female boarder who paid
      nothing for her board. The thought was anything but pleasant, but it was
      the truth. The cook kept house, the housemaid attended to the rooms. Where
      did Helena come in? She was to develop her individuality! Oh, rubbish! he
      thought, I am a fool! Supposing his friend had been right? Supposing women
      always behaved in this silly way under these circumstances? She could not
      very well come to him&mdash;he must go to her. If he didn&rsquo;t go, she would
      probably laugh at him to-morrow, or, worse still, be offended. Women were
      indeed incomprehensible. He must make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up, put on his dressing-gown and went into the drawing-room.
      With trembling knees he listened outside Helena&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound. He took heart of grace, and approached a step or two. Blue
      flashes of lightning darted before his eyes as he knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer. He trembled violently and beads of perspiration stood on his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked again. And in a falsetto voice, proceeding from a parched
      throat, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer. Overwhelmed with shame, he returned to his room, puzzled and
      chilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in earnest, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept between the sheets and again took up the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hadn&rsquo;t been reading long when he heard footsteps in the street which
      gradually approached and then stopped. Soft music fell on his ear, deep,
      strong voices set in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Integer vitae sclerisque purus....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was touched. How beautiful it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Purus! He felt lifted above matter. It was in accordance with the spirit
      of the age then, this higher conception of marriage. The current of ethics
      which penetrated the epoch was flowing through the youth of the
      country....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nec venenatis....</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supposing Helena had opened her door!
    </p>
    <p>
      He gently beat time and felt himself as great and noble as Helena desired
      him to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Fusce pharetra!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he open the window and thank the undergraduates in the name of his
      wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fourfold peal of laughter crashed against the windowpanes at the very
      moment he lifted his hand to draw up the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt, they were making fun of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside himself with anger he staggered back from the window and knocked
      against the writing-table. He was a laughing-stock. A faint hatred against
      the woman whom he had to thank for this humiliating scene, began to stir
      within him, but his love acquitted her. He was incensed against the
      jesters down below, and swore to bring them before the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again and again he reverted to his unpleasant position, furious that
      he had allowed himself to be led by the nose. He paced his room until dawn
      broke in the East. Then he threw himself on his bed and fell asleep, in
      bitter grief over the dismal ending of his wedding-day, which ought to
      have been the happiest day of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he met Helena at the breakfast table. She was
      cold and self-possessed as usual. Albert, of course, did not mention the
      serenade. Helena made great plans for the future and talked volumes about
      the abolition of prostitution. Albert met her half-way and promised to do
      all in his power to assist her. Humanity must become chaste, for only the
      beasts were unchaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, he went to his lecture. The serenade had roused his
      suspicions, and as he watched his audience, he fancied that they were
      making signs to each other; his colleagues, too, seemed to congratulate
      him in a way which offended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big, stout colleague, who radiated vigour and <i>joie de vivre</i>,
      stopped him in the corridor which led to the library, seized him by the
      collar and said with a colossal grin on his broad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; was the indignant reply with which
      he tore himself away and rushed down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived home, his flat was crowded with his wife&rsquo;s friends.
      Women&rsquo;s skirts brushed against his legs, and when he sat down in an
      armchair, he seemed to sink out of sight into piles and piles of women&rsquo;s
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumours of a serenade last night,&rdquo; said the professor&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert grew pale, but Helena took up the gauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was well meant, but they really might have been sober. This excessive
      drinking among students is terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they sing?&rdquo; asked the professor&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the usual songs: &lsquo;My life a sea,&rsquo; and so on,&rdquo; replied Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert stared at her in amazement, but he couldn&rsquo;t help admiring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day went with gossip and discussions. Albert felt tired. Been joyed
      spending a few hours, after the daily toil was over, in pleasant
      conversation with women, but this was really too much. And moreover, he
      had to agree to everything they said, for whenever he attempted to express
      a contradictory opinion, they were down on him in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night fell; it was bedtime. Husband and wife wished one another good night
      and retired to their separate rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he was attacked by doubt and restlessness. He fancied that he had
      seen a tender look on Helena&rsquo;s face, and he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure whether she
      hadn&rsquo;t squeezed his hand. He lit a cigar and unfolded his paper. As soon
      as he began to read of every-day matters, he seemed to see clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sheer madness,&rdquo; he said aloud, throwing the paper aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped on his dressing-gown and went into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody was moving in Helena&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Louise?&rdquo; asked a voice from inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only I,&rdquo; he whispered, hardly able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you, Helena,&rdquo; he answered, hardly knowing what he was
      saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key turned in the lock. Albert could hardly trust his ears. The door
      flew open. Helena stood on the threshold, still fully dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; she asked. Then she noticed that he was in his
      dressing-gown and that his eyes shone strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hand, pushed him away and slammed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a thud on the floor and almost simultaneously loud sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furious, but abashed, he returned to his room. She was in earnest, then!
      But this was certainly anything but normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay awake all night, brooding, and on the following morning he
      breakfasted alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home for lunch, Helena received him with an expression of
      pained resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you treat me like that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He apologised, with as few words as possible. Then he repented his
      curtness and climbed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus matters stood for six months. He was tossed between doubt, rage and
      love, but his chain held.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face grew pale and his eyes lost their lustre. His temper had become
      uncertain; a sullen fury smouldered beneath his outward calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena found him changed, despotic, because he was beginning to oppose
      her, and often left the meetings to seek amusement elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he was asked to become a candidate for a professorial chair. He
      refused, believing that he had no chance, but Helena gave him no peace
      until he complied with the conditions. He was elected. He never knew the
      reason why, but Helena did.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after there was a by-election.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new professor, who had never dreamed of taking an active interest in
      public affairs, was nonplussed when he found himself nominated. His
      surprise was even greater when he was elected. He intended to decline, but
      Helena&rsquo;s entreaties and her argument that life in a big city was
      preferable to an existence in a small provincial town induced him to
      accept the mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They removed to Stockholm.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these six months the newly-made professor and member of Parliament
      had made himself acquainted with the new ideas which came from England and
      purposed to recreate society and the old standards of morality. At the
      same time he felt that the moment was not far off when he would have to
      break with his &ldquo;boarder.&rdquo; He recovered his strength and vigour in
      Stockholm, where fearless thinkers encouraged him to profess openly the
      views which he had long held in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena, on the other hand, scented a favourable opportunity in the
      counter-current and threw herself into the arms of the Church Party. This
      was too much for Albert and he rebelled. His love had grown cold; he found
      compensation elsewhere. He didn&rsquo;t consider himself unfaithful to his wife
      for she had never claimed constancy in a relationship which didn&rsquo;t exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friendly intercourse with the other sex aroused his manliness and made
      him realise his degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His growing estrangement did not escape Helena. Their home-life became
      unpleasant and every moment threatened to bring a catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of Parliament was imminent. Helena became restless and seemed
      to have changed her tactics. Her voice was more gentle and she appeared
      anxious to please him. She looked after the servants and saw that the
      meals were served punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew suspicious and wondered, watched her movements and prepared for
      coming events.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, at breakfast, Helena looked embarrassed and self-conscious.
      She played with her dinner napkin and cleared her throat several times.
      Then she took her courage in both her hands and made a plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I can count on you, can&rsquo;t I? You will serve the
      Cause to which I have devoted my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cause is that?&rdquo; he asked curtly, for now he had the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do something for the oppressed women, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the oppressed women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Have you deserted our great cause? Are you leaving us in the
      lurch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cause are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Women&rsquo;s Cause!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing about it? Oh, come! You must admit that the position of
      the women of the lower classes is deplorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t see that their position is any worse than the position of the
      men. Deliver the men from their exploiters and the women too will be
      free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the unfortunates who have to sell themselves, and the scoundrels who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrels who pay! Has ever a man taken payment for a pleasure which
      both enjoy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question! The question is whether it is just that the law
      of the land should punish the one and let the other go scotfree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no injustice in that. The one has degraded herself until she has
      become a source of infection, and therefore the State treats her as it
      treats a mad dog. Whenever you find a man, degraded to that degree, well,
      put him under police control, too. Oh, you pure angels, who despise men
      and look upon them as unclean beasts!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it? What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that she had taken a manuscript from the sideboard and held it
      in her hand. Without waiting for a reply, he took it from her and began to
      examine it. &ldquo;A bill to be introduced into Parliament! I&rsquo;m to be the man of
      straw who introduces it! Is that moral? Strictly speaking, is it honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena rose from her chair, threw herself on the sofa and burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, rose and went to her. He took her hand in his and felt her pulse,
      afraid lest her attack might be serious. She seized his hand convulsively,
      and pressed it against her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go. Stay, and let me keep faith in
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life he saw her giving way to her emotions. This
      delicate body, which he had loved and admired so much, could be warmed
      into life! Red, warm blood flowed in those blue veins. Blood which could
      distil tears. He gently stroked her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;why aren&rsquo;t you always good to me like that? Why hasn&rsquo;t
      it always been so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t it? Tell me, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena&rsquo;s eyelids drooped. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she breathed, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not withdraw her hand and he felt a gentle warmth radiating from
      her velvety skin; his love for her burst into fresh flames, but this time
      he felt that there was hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despise me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t despise me, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she went into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the matter with her? Albert wondered as he went up to town. Was
      she passing through a crisis of some sort? Was she only just beginning to
      realise that she was his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the whole day in town. In the evening he went to the theatre.
      They played <i>Le monde où l&rsquo;on s&rsquo;ennuit</i>. As he sat and watched
      platonic love, the union of souls, unmasked and ridiculed, he felt as if a
      veil of close meshed lies were being drawn from his reason; he smiled as
      he saw the head of the charming beast peeping from underneath the
      card-board wings of the stage-angel; he almost shed tears of amusement at
      his long, long self-deception; he laughed at his folly. What filth and
      corruption lay behind this hypocritical morality, this insane desire for
      emancipation from healthy, natural instincts. It was the ascetic teaching
      of idealism and Christianity which had implanted this germ into the
      nineteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt ashamed! How could he have allowed himself to be duped all this
      time!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still light in Helena&rsquo;s room as he passed her door on tip-toe so
      as not to wake her. He heard her cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to bed, smoked his cigar and read his paper. He was
      absorbed in an article on conscription, when all of a sudden Helena&rsquo;s door
      was flung open, and footsteps and screams from the drawing-room fell on
      his ears. He jumped up and rushed out of his room, believing that the
      house was on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena was standing in the drawing-room in her nightgown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She screamed when she saw her husband and ran to her room; on the
      threshold she hesitated and turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Albert,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you. I didn&rsquo;t know that you
      were still up. I thought there were burglars in the house. Please, forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she closed her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it all mean? Was she in love with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his room and stood before the looking-glass. Could any woman
      fall in love with him? He was plain. But one loves with one&rsquo;s soul and
      many a plain man had married a beautiful woman. It was true, though, that
      in such cases the man had nearly always possessed wealth and influence.&mdash;Was
      Helena realising that she had placed herself in a false position? Or had
      she become aware of his intention to leave her and was anxious to win him
      back?
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met at the breakfast table on the following morning, Helena was
      unusually gentle, and the professor noticed that she was wearing a new
      morning-gown trimmed with lace, which suited her admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was helping himself to sugar, his hand accidentally touched hers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, dear,&rdquo; she said with an expression on her face which
 he had never seen before. She looked like a young girl.
</pre>
    <p>
      They talked about indifferent things.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day Parliament opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena&rsquo;s yielding mood lasted and she grew more and more affectionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period allowed for the introduction of new bills drew to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the professor came home from his club in an unusually gay
      frame of mind. He went to bed with his paper and his cigar. After a while
      he heard Helena&rsquo;s door creak. Silence, lasting for a few minutes,
      followed. Then there came a knock at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Albert, do dress and come into the drawing-room, I want to speak
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dressed and went into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena had lighted the chandelier and was sitting on the sofa, dressed in
      her lace morning-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do forgive me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t sleep. My head feels so strange.
      Come here and talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all unstrung, little girl,&rdquo; said Albert, taking her hand in his
      own. &ldquo;You ought to take some wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the dining-room and returned with a decanter and two glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your health, darling,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena drank and her cheeks caught fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked, putting his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious that the words sounded dry and artificial, but his
      passion was roused and he didn&rsquo;t care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why you are unhappy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I only know one thing, and that is that I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert caught her in his arms and kissed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you my wife, or aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your wife,&rdquo; breathed Helena, collapsing, as if every nerve in her
      body had snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altogether?&rdquo; he whispered paralysing her with his kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; she moaned, moving convulsively, like a sleeper struggling
      with the horrors of a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Albert awoke, he felt refreshed, his head was clear and he was fully
      conscious of what had happened in the night. He could think vigorously and
      logically like a man after a deep and restful sleep. The whole scene stood
      vividly before his mind. He saw the full significance of it, unvarnished,
      undisguised, in the sober light of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sold herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, intoxicated with love, blind to
      everything, half insane, he had promised to introduce her bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the price! She had given herself to him calmly, coldly, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was the first woman who found out that she could sell her favour? And
      who was the woman who discovered that man is a buyer? Whoever she was, she
      was the founder of marriage and prostitution. And they say that marriages
      are made in heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      He realised his degradation and hers. She wanted to triumph over her
      friends, to be the first woman who had taken an active share in the making
      of her country&rsquo;s laws; for the sake of this triumph she had sold herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he would tear the mask from her face. He would show her what she
      really was. He would tell her that prostitution could never be abolished
      while women found an advantage in selling themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his mind firmly made up, he got out of bed and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to wait a little for her in the dining-room. He rehearsed the scene
      which would follow and pulled himself together to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in calm, smiling, triumphant, but more beautiful than he had ever
      seen her before. A sombre fire burnt in her eyes, and he, who had expected
      that she would meet him with blushes and down-cast eyes, was crushed. She
      was the triumphant seducer, and he the bashful victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words he had meant to say refused to come. Disarmed and humble he went
      to meet her and kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked as usual without the slightest indication that a new factor had
      entered her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the House, fuming, with her bill in his pocket, and only the
      vision of the bliss in store for him, calmed his excited nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, in the evening, he knocked quite boldly at her door, it remained
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained closed for three weeks. He cringed before her like a dog,
      obeyed every hint, fulfilled all her wishes&mdash;it was all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his indignation got the better of him and he overwhelmed her with a
      flood of angry words. She answered him sharply. But when she realised that
      she had gone too far, that his chain was wearing thin, she gave herself to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he wore his chain. He bit it, strained every nerve to break it, but it
      held.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon learned how far she could go, and whenever he became restive, she
      yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seized with a fanatical longing to make her a mother. He thought it
      might make a woman of her, bring out all that was good and wholesome in
      her. But the future seemed to hold no promise on that score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had ambition, the selfish passion of the individual, destroyed the source
      of life? He wondered....
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning she informed him that she was going away for a few days to
      stay with her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home on the evening of the day of her departure and found the
      house empty, his soul was tormented by a cruel feeling of loss and
      longing. All of a sudden it became clear to him that he loved her with
      every fibre of his being. The house seemed desolate; it was just as if a
      funeral had taken place. When dinner was served he stared at her vacant
      chair and hardly touched his food.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper he lit the chandelier in the drawing-room. He sat down in her
      corner of the sofa. He fingered her needlework which she had left behind&mdash;it
      was a tiny jacket for a stranger&rsquo;s baby in a newly-founded crèche. There
      was the needle, still sticking in the calico, just as she had left it. He
      pricked his finger with it as if to find solace in the ecstasy of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he lighted a candle and went into her bedroom. As he stood on
      the threshold, he shaded the flame with his hand and looked round like a
      man who is about to commit a crime. The room did not betray the slightest
      trace of femininity. A narrow bed without curtains; a writing-table,
      bookshelves, a smaller table by the side of her bed, a sofa. Just like his
      own room. There was no dressing-table, but a little mirror hung on the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress was hanging on a nail. The lines of her body were clearly
      defined on the thick, heavy serge. He caressed the material and hid his
      face in the lace which trimmed the neck; he put his arm round the waist,
      but the dress collapsed like a phantom. &ldquo;They say the soul is a spirit,&rdquo;
       he mused, &ldquo;but then, it ought to be a tangible spirit, at least.&rdquo; He
      approached the bed as if he expected to see an apparition. He touched
      everything, took everything in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as if he were looking for something, something which should help
      him to solve the problem, he began to tug at the handles which ornamented
      the drawers of her writing-table; all the drawers were locked. As if by
      accident he opened the drawer of the little table by her bedside, and
      hastily closed it again, but not before he had read the title on the
      paper-cover of a small book and caught sight of a few strange-looking
      objects, the purpose of which he could guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was it then! <i>Facultative Sterility!</i> What was intended for a
      remedy for the lower classes, who have been robbed of the means of
      existence, had become an instrument in the service of selfishness, the
      last consequence of idealism. Were the upper classes so degenerate that
      they refused to reproduce their species, or were they morally corrupt?
      They must be both, for they considered it immoral to bring illegitimate
      children into the world, and degrading to bear children in wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wanted children! He could afford to have them, and he considered it
      a duty as well as a glorious privilege to pour his individuality into a
      new being. It was Nature&rsquo;s way from a true and healthy egoism towards
      altruism. But she travelled on another road and made jackets for the
      babies of strangers. Was that a better, a nobler thing to do? It stood for
      so much, and yet was nothing but fear of the burden of motherhood, and it
      was cheaper and less fatiguing to sit in the corner of a comfortable sofa
      and make little jackets than to bear the toil and broil of a nursery. It
      was looked upon as a disgrace to be a woman, to have a sex, to become a
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was it. They called it working for Heaven, for higher interests, for
      humanity, but it was merely a pandering to vanity, to selfishness, to a
      desire for fame or notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had pitied her, he had suffered remorse because her sterility had
      made him angry. She had told him once that he deserved &ldquo;the contempt of
      all good and honest men&rdquo; because he had failed to speak of sterile women
      with the respect due to misfortune; she had told him that they were
      sacred, because their sorrow was the bitterest sorrow a woman could have
      to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, after all, was this woman working for? For progress? For the
      salvation of humanity? No, she was working against progress, against
      freedom and enlightenment. Hadn&rsquo;t she recently brought forward a motion to
      limit religious liberty? Wasn&rsquo;t she the author of a pamphlet on the
      intractability of servants? Wasn&rsquo;t she advocating greater severity in the
      administration of the military laws? Was she not a supporter of the party
      which strives to ruin our girls by giving them the same miserable
      education which our boys receive?
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated her soul, for he hated her ideas. And yet he loved her? What was
      it then that he loved?
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably, he reflected, compelled to take refuge in philosophy, probably
      the germ of a new being, which she carries in her womb, but which she is
      bent on killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What else could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did she love in him? His title, his position, his influence?
    </p>
    <p>
      How could these old and worn-out men and women rebuild society?
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to tell her all this when she returned home; but in his inmost
      soul he knew all the time that the words would never be said. He knew that
      he would grovel before her and whine for her favour; that he would remain
      her slave and sell her his soul again and again, just as she sold him her
      body. He knew that that was what he would do, for he was head over ears in
      love with her.

    <h2>
      UNMARRIED AND MARRIED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young barrister was strolling on a lovely spring evening through the
      old Stockholm Hop-Garden. Snatches of song and music came from the
      pavilion; light streamed through the large windows and lit up the shadows
      cast by the great lime trees which were just bursting into leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, sat down at a vacant table near the platform and asked for a
      glass of punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young comedian was singing a pathetic ballad of a <i>Dead Rat</i>. Then
      a young girl, dressed in pink, appeared and sang the Danish song: <i>There
      is nothing so charming as a moonshine ride.</i> She was comparatively
      innocent looking and she addressed her song to our innocent barrister. He
      felt flattered by this mark of distinction, and at once started
      negotiations which began with a bottle of wine and ended in a furnished
      flat, containing two rooms, a kitchen and all the usual conveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not within the scope of this little story to analyse the feelings of
      the young man, or give a description of the furniture and the other
      conveniences. It must suffice if I say that they were very good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, imbued with the socialistic tendencies of our time, and desirous of
      having his lady-love always under his eyes, the young man decided to live
      in the flat himself and make his little friend his house keeper. She was
      delighted at the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young man had a family, that is to say, his family looked upon him
      as one of its members, and since in their opinion he was committing an
      offence against morality, and casting a slur on their good name, he was
      summoned to appear before the assembled parents, brothers and sisters in
      order to be censured. He considered that he was too old for such treatment
      and the family tie was ruptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made him all the more fond of his own little home, and he developed
      into a very domesticated husband, excuse me, lover. They were happy, for
      they loved one another, and no fetters bound them. They lived in the happy
      dread of losing one another and therefore they did their utmost to keep
      each other&rsquo;s love. They were indeed one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one thing which they lacked: they had no friends. Society
      displayed no wish to know them, and the young man was not asked to the
      houses of the &ldquo;Upper Ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Eve, a day of sadness for all those who once had a
      family. As he was sitting at breakfast, he received a letter. It was from
      his sister, who implored him to spend Christmas at home, with his parents.
      The letter touched upon the strings of old feelings and put him in a bad
      temper. Was he to leave his little friend alone on Christmas Eve?
      Certainly not! Should his place in the house of his parents remain vacant
      for the first time on a Christmas Eve? H&rsquo;m! This was the position of
      affairs when he went to the Law Courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the interval for lunch a colleague came up to him and asked him as
      discreetly as possible:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to spend Christmas Eve with your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flared up at once. Was his friend aware of his position? Or what did he
      mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man saw that he had stepped on a corn, and added hastily,
      without waiting for a reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if you are not, you might spend it with us. You know, perhaps,
      that I have a little friend, a dear little soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It sounded all right and he accepted the invitation on condition that they
      should both be invited. Well, but of course, what else did he think? And
      this settled the problem of friends and Christmas Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met at six o&rsquo;clock at the friend&rsquo;s flat, and while the two &ldquo;old men&rdquo;
       had a glass of punch, the women went into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All four helped to lay the table. The two &ldquo;old men&rdquo; knelt on the floor and
      tried to lengthen the table by means of boards and wedges. The women were
      on the best of terms at once, for they felt bound together by that very
      obvious tie which bears the great name of &ldquo;public opinion.&rdquo; They respected
      one another and saved one another&rsquo;s feelings. They avoided those
      innuendoes in which husbands and wives are so fond of indulging when their
      children are not listening, just as if they wanted to say: &ldquo;We have a
      right to say these things now we are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had eaten the pudding, the barrister made a speech praising the
      delights of one&rsquo;s own fireside, that refuge from the world and from all
      men: that harbour where one spends one&rsquo;s happiest hours in the company of
      one&rsquo;s real friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-Louisa began to cry, and when he urged her to tell him the cause of
      her distress, and the reason of her unhappiness, she told him in a voice
      broken by sobs that she could see that he was missing his mother and
      sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he did not miss them in the least, and that he should wish
      them far away if they happened to turn up now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t he marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they as good as married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they weren&rsquo;t married properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a clergyman? In his opinion a clergyman was nothing but a student who
      had passed his examinations, and his incantations were pure mythology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was beyond her, but she knew that something was wrong, and the other
      people in the house pointed their fingers at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophy joined in the conversation. She said she knew that they were not
      good enough for his relations; but she didn&rsquo;t mind. Let everybody keep his
      own place and be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, they had friends now, and lived together in harmony, which is more
      than could be said of many properly constituted families. The tie which
      held them together remained intact, but they were otherwise unfettered.
      They continued being lovers without contracting any bad matrimonial
      habits, as, for example, the habit of being rude to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a year or two their union was blest with a son. The mistress had
      thereby risen to the rank of a mother, and everything else was forgotten.
      The pangs which she had endured at the birth of the baby, and her care for
      the newly born infant, had purged her of her old selfish claims to all the
      good things of the earth, including the monopoly of her husband&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her new role as mother she gave herself superior little airs with her
      friend, and showed a little more assurance in her intercourse with her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the latter came home with a great piece of news. He had met his
      eldest sister in the street and had found her well informed on all their
      private affairs. She was very anxious to see her little nephew and had
      promised to pay them a call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-Louisa was surprised, and at once began to sweep and dust the flat;
      in addition she insisted on a new dress for the occasion. And then she
      waited for a whole week. The curtains were sent to the laundry, the brass
      knobs on the doors of the stoves were made to shine, the furniture was
      polished. The sister should see that her brother was living with a decent
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she made coffee, one morning at eleven o&rsquo;clock, the time when the
      sister would call.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, straight as if she had swallowed a poker, and gave Mary-Louisa a
      hand which was as stiff as a batting staff. She examined the bed-room
      furniture, but refused to drink coffee, and never once looked her
      sister-in-law in the face. But she showed a faint, though genuine,
      interest in the baby. Then she went away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-Louisa in the meantime had carefully examined her coat, priced the
      material of her dress and conceived a new idea of doing her hair. She had
      not expected any great display of cordiality. As a start, the fact of the
      visit was quite sufficient in itself, and she soon let the house know that
      her sister-in-law had called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy grew up and by and by a baby sister arrived. Now Mary-Louisa began
      to show the most tender solicitude for the future of the children, and not
      a day passed but she tried to convince their father that nothing but a
      legal marriage with her would safeguard their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this his sister gave him a very plain hint to the effect
      that a reconciliation with his parents was within the scope of
      possibility, if he would but legalise his liaison.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having fought against it day and night for two years, he consented
      at last, and resolved that for the children&rsquo;s sake the mythological
      ceremony should be allowed to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whom should they ask to the wedding? Mary-Louisa insisted on being
      married in church. In this case Sophy could not be invited. That was an
      impossibility. A girl like her! Mary-Louisa had already learnt to
      pronounce the word &ldquo;girl&rdquo; with a decidedly moral accent. He reminded her
      that Sophy had been a good friend to her, and that ingratitude was not a
      very fine quality. Mary-Louisa, however, pointed out that parents must be
      prepared to sacrifice private sympathies at the altar of their children&rsquo;s
      prospects; and she carried the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was over. No invitation arrived from his parents, but a
      furious letter from Sophy which resulted in a complete rupture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-Louisa was a wedded wife, now. But she was more lonely than she had
      been before. Embittered by her disappointment, sure of her husband who was
      now legally tied to her, she began to take all those liberties which
      married people look upon as their right. What she had once regarded in the
      light of a voluntary gift, she now considered a tribute due to her. She
      entrenched herself behind the honourable title of &ldquo;the mother of his
      children,&rdquo; and from there she made her sallies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple-minded, as all duped husbands are, he could never grasp what
      constituted the sacredness in the fact that she was the mother of <i>his</i>
      children. Why his children should be different from other children, and
      from himself, was a riddle to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, with an easy conscience, because his children had a legal mother now,
      he commenced to take again an interest in the world which he had to a
      certain extent forgotten in the first ecstasy of his love-dream, and which
      later on he had neglected because he hated to leave his wife and children
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      These liberties displeased his wife, and since there was no necessity for
      her to mince matters now, and she was of an outspoken disposition, she
      made no secrets of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had all the lawyer&rsquo;s tricks at his fingers&rsquo; ends, and was never at
      a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it right,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to leave the mother of your children
      alone at home with them, while you spend your time at a public house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you missed me,&rdquo; he answered by way of a preliminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed you? If the husband spends the housekeeping money on drink, the
      wife will miss a great many things in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To start with I don&rsquo;t drink, for I merely have a mouthful of food and
      drink a cup of coffee; secondly, I don&rsquo;t spend the housekeeping money on
      drink, for you keep it locked up: I have other funds which I spend &lsquo;on
      drink.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately women cannot stand satire, and the noose, made in fun, was
      at once thrown round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do admit, then, that you drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, I used your expression in fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fun? You are making fun of your wife? You never used to do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted the marriage ceremony. Why are things so different now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we are married, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly because of that, and partly because intoxication has the quality
      of passing off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only intoxication in your case, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only in my case; in your case, too, and in all others as well. It
      passes off more or less quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so love is nothing but intoxication as far as a man is concerned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as a woman is concerned too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but intoxication!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so! But there is no reason why one shouldn&rsquo;t remain friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One need not get married for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and that&rsquo;s exactly what I meant to point out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Wasn&rsquo;t it you who insisted on our marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because you worried me about it day and night three long years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was your wish, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because you wished it. Be grateful to me now that you&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I be grateful because you leave the mother of your children alone
      with them while you spend your time at the public-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not for that, but because I married you!&rdquo; &ldquo;You really think I ought
      to be grateful for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like all decent people who have got their way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is no happiness in a marriage like ours. Your family doesn&rsquo;t
      acknowledge me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to do with my family? I haven&rsquo;t married yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you didn&rsquo;t think it good enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mine was good enough for you. If they had been shoemakers, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk of shoemakers as if they were beneath your notice. Aren&rsquo;t they
      human beings like everybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they are, but I don&rsquo;t think you would have run after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Have your own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not all right, and it was never again all right. Was it due to
      the fact of their being married, or was it due to something else?
      Mary-Louisa could not help admitting in her heart that the old times had
      been better times; they had been &ldquo;jollier&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think that it was only owing to the fact that their marriage
      had been legalised for he had observed that other marriages, too, were not
      happy. And the worst of it all was this: when one day he went to see his
      old friend and Sophy, as he sometimes did, behind his wife&rsquo;s back, he was
      told that there was an end to that matter. And they had not been married.
      So it could not have been marriage which was to blame.

    <h2>
      A DUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was plain and therefore the coarse young men who don&rsquo;t know how to
      appreciate a beautiful soul in an ugly body took no notice of her. But she
      was wealthy, and she knew that men run after women for the sake of their
      wealth; whether they do it because all wealth has been created by men and
      they therefore claim the capital for their sex, or on other grounds, was
      not quite clear to her. As she was a rich woman, she learned a good many
      things, and as she distrusted and despised men, she was considered an
      intellectual young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reached the age of twenty. Her mother was still alive, but she had
      no intention to wait for another five years before she became her own
      mistress. Therefore she quite suddenly surprised her friends with an
      announcement of her engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is marrying because she wants a husband,&rdquo; said some.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is marrying because she wants a footman and her liberty,&rdquo; said
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of her to get married,&rdquo; said the third; &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t know that
      she will be even less her own mistress than she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the fourth, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll hold her own in spite of her
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was he like? Who was he? Where had she found him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young lawyer, rather effeminate in appearance, with broad hips
      and a shy manner. He was an only son, brought up by his mother and aunt.
      He had always been very much afraid of girls, and he detested the officers
      on account of their assurance, and because they were the favourites at all
      entertainments. That is what he was like.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were staying at a watering place and met at a dance. He had come late
      and all the girls&rsquo; programmes were full. A laughing, triumphant &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was
      flung into his face wherever he asked for a dance, and a movement of the
      programme brushed him away as if he were a buzzing fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offended and humiliated he left the ball-room and sat down on the verandah
      to smoke a cigar. The moon threw her light on the lime-trees in the Park
      and the perfume of the mignonette rose from the flower beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the dancing couples through the windows with the impotent
      yearning of the cripple; the voluptuous rhythm of the waltz thrilled him
      through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone and lost in dreams?&rdquo; said a voice suddenly. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you
      dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he replied, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am plain and nobody asked me to,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. They had known each other for some time, but he had
      never studied her features. She was exquisitely dressed, and in her eyes
      lay an expression of infinite pain, the pain of despair and vain revolt
      against the injustice of nature; he felt a lively sympathy for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, am scorned by everybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All the rights belong to the
      officers. Whenever it is a question of natural selection, right is on the
      side of the strong and the beautiful. Look at their shoulders and
      epaulettes....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you talk like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon! To have to play a losing game makes a man bitter! Will
      you give me a dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Out of compassion for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw away his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever known what it means to be marked by the hand of fate, and
      rejected? To be always the last?&rdquo; he began again, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known all that! But the last do not always remain the last,&rdquo; she
      added, emphatically. &ldquo;There are other qualities, besides beauty, which
      count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What quality do you appreciate most in a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindness,&rdquo; she exclaimed, without the slightest hesitation. &ldquo;For this is
      a quality very rarely found in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindness and weakness usually go hand in hand; women admire strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of women are you talking about? Rude strength has had its day;
      our civilisation has reached a sufficiently high standard to make us value
      muscles and rude strength no more highly than a kind heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to have! And yet&mdash;watch the dancing couples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my mind true manliness is shown in loftiness of sentiment and
      intelligence of the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently a man whom the whole world calls weak and cowardly....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care for the world and its opinion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you are a very remarkable woman?&rdquo; said the young lawyer,
      feeling more and more interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least remarkable! But you men are accustomed to regard women
      as dolls....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of men do you mean? I, dear lady, have from my childhood looked
      up to woman as a higher manifestation of the species man, and from the day
      on which I fell in love with a woman, and she returned my love, I should
      be her slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adeline looked at him long and searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a remarkable man,&rdquo; she said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each of the two had declared the other to be a remarkable specimen
      of the species man, and made a good many remarks on the futility of
      dancing, they began to talk of the melancholy influence of the moon. Then
      they returned to the ball-room and took their place in a set of
      quadrilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adeline was a perfect dancer and the lawyer won her heart completely
      because he &ldquo;danced like an innocent girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the set was over, they went out again on the verandah and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is love?&rdquo; asked Adeline, looking at the moon as if she expected an
      answer from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sympathy of the souls,&rdquo; he replied, and his voice sounded like the
      whispering breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sympathy may turn to antipathy; it has happened frequently,&rdquo; objected
      Adeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t genuine! There are materialists who say that there would
      be no such thing as love if there weren&rsquo;t two sexes, and they dare to
      maintain that sensual love is more lasting than the love of the soul.
      Don&rsquo;t you think it low and bestial to see nothing but sex in the beloved
      woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of the materialists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must, so that you may realise the loftiness of my feelings for a
      woman, if ever I fell in love. She need not be beautiful; beauty soon
      fades. I should look upon her as a dear friend, a chum. I should never
      feel shy in her company, as with any ordinary girl. I should approach her
      without fear, as I am approaching you, and I should say: &lsquo;Will you be my
      friend for life?&rsquo; I should be able to speak to her without the slightest
      tremor of that nervousness which a lover is supposed to feel when he
      proposes to the object of his tenderness, because his thoughts are not
      pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adeline looked at the young man, who had taken her hand in his, with
      enraptured eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an idealist,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I agree with you from the very
      bottom of my heart. You are asking for my friendship, if I understand you
      rightly. It shall be yours, but I must put you to the test first. Will you
      prove to me that you can pocket your pride for the sake of a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak and I shall obey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adeline took off a golden chain with a locket which she had been wearing
      round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wear this as a symbol of our friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wear it,&rdquo; he said, in an uncertain voice; &ldquo;but it might make the
      people think that we are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not if you don&rsquo;t! Will you be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Axel! I will! For the world looks askance at friendship between man
      and woman; the world is so base that it refuses to believe in the
      possibility of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wore the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world, which is very materialistic at heart, repeated the verdict of
      her friends:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She marries him in order to be married; he marries her because he wants a
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world made nasty remarks, too. It said that he was marrying her for
      the sake of her money; for hadn&rsquo;t he himself declared that anything so
      degrading as love did not exist between them? There was no need for
      friends to live together like married couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place. The world had received a hint that they would live
      together like brother and sister, and the world awaited with a malicious
      grin the result of the great reform which should put matrimony on another
      basis altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newly married couple went abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned, the young wife was pale and ill-tempered. She began at
      once to take riding-lessons. The world scented mischief and waited. The
      man looked as if he were guilty of a base act and was ashamed of himself.
      It all came out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have <i>not</i> been living like brother and sister,&rdquo; said the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Without loving one another? But that is&mdash;well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forbidden relationship!&rdquo; said the materialists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a spiritual marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or incest,&rdquo; suggested an anarchist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facts remained facts, but the sympathy was on the wane. Real life,
      stripped of All make-believe, confronted them and began to take revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer practised his profession, but the wife&rsquo;s profession was
      practised by a maid and a nurse. Therefore she had no occupation. The want
      of occupation encouraged brooding, and she brooded a great deal over her
      position. She found it unsatisfactory. Was it right that an intellectual
      woman like her should spend her days in idleness? Once her husband had
      ventured to remark that no one compelled her to live in idleness. He never
      did it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had no profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; to be idle was no profession. Why didn&rsquo;t she nurse the baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse the baby? She wanted a profession which brought in money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she such a miser, then? She had already more than she knew how to
      spend; why should she want to earn money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be on an equal footing with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could never be, for she would always be in a position to which he
      could never hope to attain. It was nature&rsquo;s will that the woman was to be
      the mother, not the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very stupid arrangement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely! The opposite might have been the case, but that would have
      been equally stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but her life was unbearable. It didn&rsquo;t satisfy her to live for the
      family only, she wanted to live for others as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t she better begin with the family? There was plenty of time to
      think of the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation might have continued through all eternity; as it was it
      only lasted an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was, of course, away almost all day long, and even when he was
      at home he had his consulting hours. It drove Adeline nearly mad. He was
      always locked in his consulting-room with other women who confided
      information to him which he was bound to keep secret. These secrets formed
      a barrier between them, and made her feel that he was more than a match
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It roused a sullen hatred in her heart; she resented the injustice of
      their mutual relationship; she sought for a means to drag him down. Come
      down he must, so that they should be on the same level.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she proposed the foundation of a sanatorium. He said all he could
      against it, for he was very busy with his practice. But on further
      consideration he thought that occupation of some sort might be the saving
      of her; perhaps it would help her to settle down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sanatorium was founded; he was one of the directors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on the Committee and ruled. When she had ruled for six months, she
      imagined herself so well up in the art of healing that she interviewed
      patients and gave them advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it happened that the house-surgeon made a mistake, and she
      straightway lost all confidence in him. It further happened that one day,
      in the full consciousness of her superior wisdom, she prescribed for a
      patient herself, in the doctor&rsquo;s absence. The patient had the prescription
      made up, took it and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      This necessitated a removal to another centre of activity. But it
      disturbed the equilibrium. A second child, which was born about the same
      time, disturbed it still more and, to make matters worse, a rumour of the
      fatal accident was spreading through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations between husband and wife were unlovely and sad, for there
      had never been any love between them. The healthy, powerful natural
      instinct, which does not reflect, was absent; what remained was an
      unpleasant liaison founded on the uncertain calculations of a selfish
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never voiced the thoughts hatched behind her burning brow after she
      had discovered that she was mistaken in believing that she had a higher
      mission, but she made her husband suffer for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her health failed; she lost her appetite and refused to go out. She grew
      thin and seemed to be suffering from a chronic cough. The husband made her
      repeatedly undergo medical examinations, but the doctors were unable to
      discover the cause of her malady. In the end he became so accustomed to
      her constant complaints that he paid no more attention to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s unpleasant to have an invalid wife,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admitted in his heart that it was anything but pleasant; had he loved
      her, he would neither have felt nor admitted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her emaciation became so alarming, that he could not shut his eyes to it
      any longer, and had to consent to her suggestion that she should consult a
      famous professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adeline was examined by the celebrity. &ldquo;How long have you been ill?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been very strong since I left the country,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
      was born in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t feel well in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Who cares whether I feel well or not?&rdquo; And her face assumed an
      expression which left no room for doubt: she was a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that country air would do you good?&rdquo; continued the
      professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candidly, I believe that it is the only thing which could save my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you live in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband couldn&rsquo;t give up his profession for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a wealthy wife and we have plenty of lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that we ought to live in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you believe that it would do you good. You are not
      suffering from any organic disease, but your nerves are unstrung; country
      air would no doubt benefit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adeline returned home to her husband very depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The professor had sentenced her to death if she remained in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was much upset. But since the fact that his distress was mainly
      caused by the thought of giving up his practice was very apparent, she
      held that she had absolute proof that the question of her health was a
      matter of no importance to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? He didn&rsquo;t believe that it was a matter of life and death? Didn&rsquo;t he
      think the professor knew better than he? Was he going to let her die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not going to let her die. He bought an estate in the country and
      engaged an inspector to look after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a sheriff and a district-judge were living on the spot, the lawyer had
      no occupation. The days seemed to him as endless as they were unpleasant.
      Since his income had stopped with his practice, he was compelled to live
      on his wife&rsquo;s money. In the first six months he read a great deal and
      played &ldquo;Fortuna.&rdquo; In the second six months he gave up reading, as it
      served no object. In the third he amused himself by doing needle-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, on the other hand, devoted herself to the farm, pinned up her
      skirts to the knees and went into the stables. She came into the house
      dirty, and smelling of the cow-shed. She felt well and ordered the
      labourers about that it was a pleasure to hear her, for she had grown up
      in the country and knew what she was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her husband complained of having nothing to do, she laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find some occupation in the house. No one need ever be idle in a house
      like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to suggest some outside occupation, but he had not the
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate, slept, and went for walks. If he happened to enter the barn or the
      stables, he was sure to be in the way and be scolded by his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when he had grumbled more than usual, while the children had been
      running about, neglected by the nurse, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look after the children? That would give you something to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her. Did she really mean it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t he look after the children? Was there anything
      strange in her suggestion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought the matter over and found nothing strange in it. Henceforth he
      took the children for a walk every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when he was ready to go out, the children were not dressed.
      The lawyer felt angry and went grumbling to his wife; of the servants he
      was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t the children dressed?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Mary is busy with other things. Why don&rsquo;t you dress them? You&rsquo;ve
      nothing else to do. Do you consider it degrading to dress your own
      children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered the matter for a while, but could see nothing degrading in
      it. He dressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he felt inclined to take his gun and go out by himself, although
      he never shot anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife met him on his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take the children for a walk this morning?&rdquo; she asked
      sharply and reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t feel inclined to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t feel inclined? Do you think I want to work all day long in
      stable and barn? One ought to do <i>something</i> useful during the day,
      even if it does go against one&rsquo;s inclination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as to pay for one&rsquo;s dinner, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to put it that way! If I were a big man like you, I should be
      ashamed to be lying all day long on a sofa, doing nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He really felt ashamed, and henceforth he established himself the
      children&rsquo;s nurse. He never failed in his duties. He saw no disgrace in it,
      yet he was unhappy. Something was wrong, somewhere, he thought, but his
      wife always managed to carry her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in the office and interviewed inspector and overseer; she stood in
      the store-room and weighed out stores for the cottagers. Everybody who
      came on the estate asked for the mistress, nobody ever wanted to see the
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he took the children past a field in which cattle were grazing. He
      wanted to show them the cows and cautiously took them up to the grazing
      herd. All at once a black head, raised above the backs of the other
      animals, stared at the visitors, bellowing softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer picked up the children and ran back to the fence as hard as he
      could. He threw them over and tried to jump it himself, but was caught on
      the top. Noticing some women on the other side, he shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bull! the bull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the women merely laughed, and went to pull the children, whose clothes
      were covered with mud, out of the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the bull?&rdquo; he screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no bull, sir,&rdquo; replied the eldest of the women, &ldquo;the bull was killed
      a fortnight ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came home, angry and ashamed and complained of the women to his wife.
      But she only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, as husband and wife were together in the drawing-room,
      there was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the women who had witnessed the adventure with the bull came in,
      holding in her hand the lawyer&rsquo;s gold chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe this belongs to you, M&rsquo;m,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adeline looked first at the woman and then at her husband, who stared at
      the chain with wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it belongs to your master,&rdquo; she said, taking the proffered chain.
      &ldquo;Thank you! Your master will give you something for finding it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting there, pale and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money, ask my wife to give you something,&rdquo; he said, taking the
      necklet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adeline took a crown out of her big purse and handed it to the woman, who
      went away, apparently without understanding the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have spared me this humiliation!&rdquo; he said, and his voice
      plainly betrayed the pain he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not man enough to take the responsibility for your words and
      actions on your own shoulders? Are you ashamed to wear a present I gave
      you, while you expect me to wear yours? You&rsquo;re a coward! And you imagine
      yourself to be a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the poor lawyer had no peace. Wherever he went, he met grinning
      faces, and farm-labourers and maid-servants from the safe retreat of
      sheltered nooks, shouted &ldquo;the bull! the bull!&rdquo; whenever he went past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adeline had resolved to attend an auction and stay away for a week. She
      asked her husband to look after the servants in her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day the cook came and asked him for money for sugar and
      coffee. He gave it to her. Three days later she came again and asked him
      for the same thing. He expressed surprise at her having already spent what
      he had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it all for myself,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and mistress doesn&rsquo;t
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her the money. But, wondering whether he had made a mistake, he
      opened his wife&rsquo;s account book and began to add up the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at a strange result. When he had added up all the pounds for a
      month, he found it came to a lispound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued checking her figures, and the result was everywhere the same.
      He took the principal ledger and found that, leaving the high figures out
      of the question, very stupid mistakes in the additions had been made.
      Evidently his wife knew nothing of denominate quantities or decimal
      fractions. This unheard of cheating of the servants must certainly lead to
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife came home. After having listened to a detailed account of the
      auction, he cleared his throat, intending to tell his tale, but his wife
      anticipated his report:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how did you get on with the servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well, but I am certain that they cheat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheat me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for instance the amount spent on coffee and sugar is too large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it in your account book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You poked your nose into my books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poked my nose into your books? No, but I took it upon me to check
      your....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business was it of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I found that you keep books without having the slightest knowledge of
      denominate quantities or decimal fractions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You think I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t! And therefore the foundations of the establishment are
      shaky. Your book-keeping is all humbug, old girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My book-keeping concerns no one but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incorrect book-keeping is an offence punishable by law; if you are not
      liable, then I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law? I care a fig for the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay! But we shall get into its clutches, if not you, then most
      certainly I! And therefore I am going to be book-keeper in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can engage a man to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not necessary! I have nothing else to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that settled the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once the husband occupied the chair at the desk and the people came to
      see <i>him</i>, the wife lost all interest in farming and cattle-breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent reaction set in; she no longer attended to the cows and calves,
      but remained in the house. There she sat, hatching fresh plots.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the husband had regained a fresh hold on life. He took an eager
      interest in the estate and woke up the people. Now he held the reins;
      managed everything, gave orders and paid the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day his wife came into the office and asked him for a thousand crowns
      to buy a piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; said the husband. &ldquo;Just when we are going to
      re-build the stables! We haven&rsquo;t the means to buy a piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t we got the means? Isn&rsquo;t my
      money sufficient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my money, my dowry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has now become the property of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the family&rsquo;s. The family is a small community, the only one which
      possesses common property which, as a rule, is administered by the
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he administer it and not the wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has more time to give to it, since he does not bear children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t they administer it jointly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason that a joint stock company has only one managing
      director. If the wife administered as well, the children would claim the
      same right, for it is their property, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is mere hair-splitting. I think it&rsquo;s hard that I should have to ask
      your permission to buy a piano out of my own money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not mine either, but the family&rsquo;s. And you are wrong when you say
      that you &lsquo;have to ask for my permission&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s merely wise that you should
      consult with the administrator as to whether the position of affairs
      warrants your spending such a large sum on a luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call a piano a luxury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new piano, when there is an old one, must be termed a luxury. The
      position of our affairs is anything but satisfactory, and therefore it
      doesn&rsquo;t permit you to buy a new piano at present, but <i>I</i>,
      personally, can or will have nothing to say against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An expenditure of a thousand crowns doesn&rsquo;t mean ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To incur a debt of a thousand crowns at the wrong time may be the first
      step towards ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this means that you refuse to buy me a new piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t say that. The uncertain position of affairs....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, oh! when will the day dawn on which the wife will manage her own
      affairs and have no need to go begging to her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she works herself. A man, your father, has earned your money. The
      men have gained all the wealth there is in the world; therefore it is but
      just that a sister should inherit less than her brother, especially as the
      brother is born with the duty to provide for a woman, while the sister
      need not provide for a man. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call that justice? Can you honestly maintain that it is? Ought we
      not all to share and share alike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not always. One ought to share according to circumstances and merit.
      The idler who lies in the grass and watches the mason building a house,
      should have a smaller share than the mason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate that I am lazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I&rsquo;d rather not say anything about that. But when I used to lie on
      the sofa, reading, you considered me a loafer, and I well remember that
      you said something to that effect in very plain language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the children out for walks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not constituted to look after the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was a time when I had to do it. Let me tell you that a woman
      who says that she is not constituted to look after children, isn&rsquo;t a
      woman. But that fact doesn&rsquo;t make a man of her, by any means. What is she,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you that you should speak like that of the mother of your
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the world call a man who will have nothing to do with women?
      Isn&rsquo;t it something very ugly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear another word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she left him and locked herself into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell ill. The doctor, the almighty man, who took over the care of the
      body when the priest lost the care of the soul, pronounced country air and
      solitude to be harmful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were obliged to return to town so that the wife could have proper
      medical treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Town had a splendid effect on her health; the air of the slums gave colour
      to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer practised his profession and so husband and wife had found
      safety-valves for their temperaments which refused to blend.

    <h2>
      HIS SERVANT OR DEBIT AND CREDIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Blackwood was a wharfinger at Brooklyn and had married Miss Dankward,
      who brought him a dowry of modern ideas. To avoid seeing his beloved wife
      playing the part of his servant, Mr. Blackwood had taken rooms in a
      boarding house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife, who had nothing whatever to do, spent the day in playing
      billiards and practising the piano, and half the night in discussing
      Women&rsquo;s Rights and drinking whiskies and sodas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband had a salary of five thousand dollars. He handed over his
      money regularly to his wife who took charge of it. She had, moreover, a
      dress allowance of five hundred dollars with which she did as she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a baby arrived. A nurse was engaged who, for a hundred dollars, took
      upon her shoulders the sacred duties of the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more children were born.
    </p>
    <p>
      They grew up and the two eldest went to school. But Mrs. Blackwood was
      bored and had nothing with which to occupy her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning she appeared at the breakfast table, slightly intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband ventured to tell her that her behaviour was unseemly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hysterics and went to bed, and all the other ladies in the house
      called on her and brought her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you drink so much whisky?&rdquo; asked her husband, as kindly as
      possible. &ldquo;Is there anything which troubles you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I be happy when my whole life is wasted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by wasted? You are the mother of three children and you
      might spend your time in educating them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be bothered with them! You would be benefiting the
      whole community and have a splendid object in life, a far more honourable
      one, for instance, than that of being a wharfinger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I were free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are freer than I am. I am under your rule. You decide how my earnings
      are to be spent. You have five hundred dollars pin money to spend as you
      like; but I have no pin money. I have to make an application to the
      cash-box, in other words, to you, whenever I want to buy tobacco. Don&rsquo;t
      you think that you are freer than I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply; she tried to think the question out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of it was that they decided to have a home of their own. And
      they set up house-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwood wrote a little later on to a friend of
      hers, &ldquo;I am ill and tired to death. But I must go on suffering, for there
      is no solace for an unhappy woman who has no object in life. I will show
      the world that I am not the sort of woman who is content to live on her
      husband&rsquo;s bounty, and therefore I shall work myself to death....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the first day she rose at nine o&rsquo;clock and turned out her husband&rsquo;s
      room. Then she dismissed the cook and at eleven o&rsquo;clock she went out to do
      the catering for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband came home at one o&rsquo;clock, lunch was not ready. It was the
      maid&rsquo;s fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blackwood was dreadfully tired and in tears. The husband could not
      find it in his heart to complain. He ate a burnt cutlet and went back to
      his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work so hard, darling,&rdquo; he said, as he was leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening his wife was so tired that she could not finish her work
      and went to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, as Mr. Blackwood went into his wife&rsquo;s room to
      say good morning to her, he was amazed at her healthy complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you slept well?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are looking so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;am&mdash;looking&mdash;well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little occupation seems to agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little occupation? You call it little? I should like to know what you
      would call much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, I didn&rsquo;t mean to annoy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did. You meant to imply that I wasn&rsquo;t working hard enough. And
      yet I turned out your room yesterday, just as if I were a house-maid, and
      stood in the kitchen like a cook. Can you deny that I am your servant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In going out the husband said to the maid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better get up at seven in future and do my room. Your mistress
      shouldn&rsquo;t have to do your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Mr. Blackwood came home in high spirits but his wife was
      angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I not to do your room?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I object to your being my servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought of it makes me unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t make you unhappy to think of me cooking your dinner and
      attending to your children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark set him thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered the question during the whole of his tram journey to Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came home in the evening, he had done a good deal of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to me, my love,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about your
      position in the house and, of course, I am far from wishing that you
      should be my servant. I think the best thing to do is this: You must look
      upon me as your boarder and I&rsquo;ll pay for myself. Then you&rsquo;ll be mistress
      in the house, and I&rsquo;ll pay you for my dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his wife, a little uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. Let&rsquo;s pretend that you keep a boarding-house and that I&rsquo;m
      your boarder. We&rsquo;ll only pretend it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! And what are you going to pay me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to prevent me from being under an obligation to you. It will
      improve my position, too, for then I shall not feel that I am kept out of
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you give me a dinner which is only half-cooked, and then you go on
      repeating that you are my servant, that is to say, that you are working
      yourself to death for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is three dollars a day enough for my board? Any boarding-house will take
      me for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dollars ought to be plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Let&rsquo;s say a thousand dollars per annum. Here&rsquo;s the money in
      advance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid a bill on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was made out as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Rent                               500 dollars
  Nurse&rsquo;s wages                      100    &rdquo;
   Cook&rsquo;s wages                       150    &rdquo;
   Wife&rsquo;s maintenance                 500    &rdquo;
   Wife&rsquo;s pin money                   500    &rdquo;
   Nurse&rsquo;s maintenance                300    &rdquo;
   Cook&rsquo;s maintenance                 300    &rdquo;
   Children&rsquo;s maintenance             700    &rdquo;
   Children&rsquo;s clothes                 500    &rdquo;
   Wood, light, assistance            500    &rdquo;
 
                                 4.500 dollars
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divide this sum by two, since we share expenses equally, that leaves 2025
      dollars. Deduct my thousand dollars and give me 1025 dollars. If you have
      got the money by you, all the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Share expenses equally?&rdquo; was all the wife could say. &ldquo;Do you expect me to
      pay you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, if we are to be on a footing of equality. I pay for half
      of your and the children&rsquo;s support. Or do you want me to pay the whole?
      Very well, that would mean that I should have to pay you 4050 dollars plus
      1000 dollars for my board. But I pay separately for rent, food, light,
      wood and servants&rsquo; wages. What do I get for my three dollars a day for
      board? The preparation of the food? Nothing else but that for 4050
      dollars? Now, if I subtract really half of this sum, that is to say, my
      share of the expenses, 2025 dollars, then the preparation of my food costs
      me 2025 dollars. But I have already paid the cook for doing it; how, then,
      can I be expected to pay 2025 dollars, plus 1000 dollars for food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I. But I know that I owe you nothing after paying for the
      whole of your support, the children&rsquo;s support and the servants&rsquo; support;
      the servants who do your work, which, in your opinion, is equal, or
      superior, to mine. But even if your work should really be worth more, you
      must remember that you have another five hundred dollars in addition to
      the household expenses, while I have nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that I don&rsquo;t understand your figures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I. Perhaps we had better abandon the idea of the
      boarding-house. Let&rsquo;s put down the debit and credit of the establishment.
      Here&rsquo;s the account, if you&rsquo;d like to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To Mrs. Blackwood for assistance in the house, and to Mrs. Blackwood&rsquo;s
  cook and nursemaid:

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s too bad of you to worry your wife with bills!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With counter-bills! And even that one you need not pay, for I pay all
      bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife crumpled up the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to pay for your children&rsquo;s education, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will, and I shall, and I will also pay for your children&rsquo;s
      education. You shall not pay one single farthing for mine. Is that being
      on a footing of equality? But I shall deduct the sum for the maintenance
      of my children and servants: then you will still have 2100 dollars for the
      assistance you give to my servants. Do you want any more bills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wanted no more; never again.

    <h2>
      THE BREADWINNER
    </h2>
    <p>
      He wakes up in the morning from evil dreams of bills which have become due
      and copy which has not been delivered. His hair is damp with cold
      perspiration, and his cheeks tremble as he dresses himself. He listens to
      the chirruping of the children in the next room and plunges his burning
      face into cold water. He drinks the coffee which he has made himself, so
      as not to disturb the nursery maid at the early hour of eight o&rsquo;clock.
      Then he makes his bed, brushes his clothes, and sits down to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fever attacks him, the fever which is to create hallucinations of
      rooms he has never seen, landscapes which never existed, people whose
      names cannot be found in the directory. He sits at his writing table in
      mortal anguish. His thoughts must be clear, pregnant and picturesque, his
      writing legible, the story dramatic; the interest must never abate, the
      metaphors must be striking, the dialogue brilliant. The faces of those
      automata, the public, whose brains he is to wind up, are grinning at him;
      the critics whose good-will he must enlist, stare at him through the
      spectacles of envy; he is haunted by the gloomy face of the publisher,
      which it is his task to brighten. He sees the jurymen sitting round the
      black table in the centre of which lies a Bible; he hears the sound of the
      opening of prison doors behind which free-thinkers are suffering for the
      crime of having thought bold thoughts for the benefit of the sluggards; he
      listens to the noiseless footfall of the hotel porter who is coming with
      the bill....
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while the fever is raging and his pen flies, flies over the
      paper without a moment&rsquo;s delay at the vision of publisher or jurymen,
      leaving in its track red lines as of congealed blood which slowly turn to
      black.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rises from his chair, after a couple of hours, he has only enough
      strength left to stumble across the room. He sinks down on his bed and
      lies there as if Death held him in his clutches. It is not invigorating
      sleep which has closed his eyes, but a stupor, a long fainting fit during
      which he remains conscious, tortured by the horrible thought that his
      strength is gone, his nervous system shattered, his brain empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the bell of the private hotel! <i>Voilà le facteur</i>! The mail
      has arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rouses himself and staggers out of his room. A pile of letters is
      handed to him. Proofs which must be read at once; a book from a young
      author, begging for a candid criticism: a paper containing a controversial
      article to which he must reply without delay, a request for a contribution
      to an almanac, an admonishing letter from his publisher. How can an
      invalid cope with it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the children&rsquo;s nurse has got up and dressed the children,
      drunk the coffee made for her in the hotel kitchen, and eaten the rolls
      spread with honey which have been sent up for her. After breakfast she
      takes a stroll in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock the bell rings for luncheon. All the guests are assembled
      in the dining-room. He, too, is there, sitting at the table by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your wife?&rdquo; he is asked on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute!&rdquo; is the comment of the ladies, who are still in their
      morning gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of his wife interrupts the progress of the meal, and the
      hungry guests who have been punctual are kept waiting for the second
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies enquire anxiously whether his, wife has slept well and feels
      refreshed? Nobody asks him how he feels. There is no need to enquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a corpse,&rdquo; says one of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she is right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dissipation,&rdquo; says another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is anything but true. He takes no part in the conversation, for
      he has nothing to say to these women. But his wife talks for two. While he
      swallows his food, his ears are made to listen to rich praise of all that
      is base, and vile abuse of all that is noble and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon is over he takes his wife aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would send Louisa to the tailor&rsquo;s with my coat; a seam has
      come undone and I haven&rsquo;t the time to sew it up myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She makes no reply, but instead of sending the coat by Louisa, she takes
      it herself and walks to the village where the tailor lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the garden she meets some of her emancipated friends who ask her where
      she is going.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replies, truthfully enough, that she is going to the tailor&rsquo;s for her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy sending her to the tailor&rsquo;s! And she allows him to treat her like a
      servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While he is lying on the bed, taking an after-dinner nap! A nice
      husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is quite true, he is taking an after dinner nap, for he is suffering
      from anaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock the postman rings again; he is expected to answer a
      letter from Berlin in German, one from Paris in French, and one from
      London in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, who has returned from the tailor&rsquo;s and refreshed herself with a
      cognac, asks him whether he feels inclined to make an excursion with the
      children. No, he has letters to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he has finished his letters, he goes out for a stroll before dinner.
      He is longing for somebody to talk to. But he is alone. He goes into the
      garden and looks for the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout nurse is sitting on a garden seat, reading Mrs. Leffler&rsquo;s <i>True
      Women</i> which his wife has lent her. The children are bored, they want
      to run about or go for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take the children for a walk, Louisa?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress said it was too hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife&rsquo;s orders!
    </p>
    <p>
      He calls to the children and walks with them towards the high road;
      suddenly he notices that their hands and faces are dirty and their boots
      in holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are the children allowed to wear such boots?&rdquo; he asks Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress said....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife said!
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes for a walk by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is seven o&rsquo;clock and dinner-time. The ladies have not yet returned to
      the hotel. The two first courses have been served when they arrive with
      flushed faces, talking and laughing loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife and her friend are in high spirits and smell of cognac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing with yourself all day, daddy?&rdquo; she asks her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went for a walk with the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Louisa there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, but she was otherwise engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too much to ask of a man to keep an eye on his
      own children,&rdquo; says the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; answers the husband. &ldquo;And therefore I scolded Louisa
      for allowing the children to run about with dirty faces and worn-out
      boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never come home but I am scolded,&rdquo; says the wife; &ldquo;You spoil every
      little pleasure I have with your fault-finding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a tiny tear moistens her reddened eyelids. The friend and all the rest
      of the ladies cast indignant glances at the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attack is imminent and the friend sharpens her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody here present read Luther&rsquo;s views on the right of a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right is that?&rdquo; asks his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look out for another partner if she is dissatisfied with the one she
      has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very risky doctrine as far as a woman&rsquo;s interests are concerned,&rdquo; says
      the husband, &ldquo;for it follows that in similar circumstances a man is
      justified in doing the same thing. The latter happens much more frequently
      than the former.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean,&rdquo; says the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither Luther&rsquo;s fault nor mine,&rdquo; answers the husband. &ldquo;Just as it
      is not necessarily the husband&rsquo;s fault if he doesn&rsquo;t get on with his wife.
      Possibly he would get on excellently with another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence follows; the diners rise from their chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband retires to his own room. His wife and her friend leave the
      dining-room together and sit down in the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brutality!&rdquo; exclaims the friend. &ldquo;How can you, a sensitive,
      intelligent woman, consent to be the servant of that selfish brute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never understood me,&rdquo; sighs the wife. Her satisfaction in being
      able to pronounce these damning words is so great, that it drowns the
      memory of a reply which her husband has given her again and again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine that your thoughts are so profound that I, a man with a
      subtle brain, am unable to fathom them? Has it never occurred to you that
      it may be your shallowness which prevents you from understanding me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sits down in his room, alone. He suffers from remorse, as if he had
      struck his mother. But she struck the first blow; she has struck him blow
      after blow, for many years, and never once before has he retaliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This coarse, heartless, cynical woman, in whose keeping he confided his
      whole soul with all its thoughts and emotions, was conscious of his
      superiority, and therefore she humiliated him, dragged him down, pulled
      him by the hair, covered him with abuse. Was it a crime that he struck
      back when she publicly taunted him? Yes&mdash;he felt as guilty as if he
      had murdered his dearest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight of the warm summer night deepens and the moon rises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of music from the drawing-room floats through his window. He
      goes into the garden and sits down under a walnut tree. Alone! The chords
      of the piano blend with the words of the song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    When the veil of night was drawn
    And crowded earth, mysterious sea
    Became one sweet, enchanted ground
    For us, until the starless dawn
    Dissolved the failing moon&mdash;then we
    In one long ecstasy were bound.
    Now, I, alone in silence and in pain
    Weep for the ache of well-remembered bliss,
    For you who never can return again,
    For you, my spring time, for your love, your kiss.
</pre>
    <p>
      He strolls through the garden and looks through the window. There she
      sits, his living poem, which he has composed for his own delight. She
      sings with tears in her voice. The ladies on the sofas look at one another
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behind the laurel bushes on a garden seat two men are sitting,
      smoking, and chatting. He can hear what they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but the effect of the cognac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they say that she drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And blame the husband for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame! She took to drinking in Julian&rsquo;s studio. She was going to
      be an artist, you know, but she didn&rsquo;t succeed. When they rejected her
      picture at the exhibition, she threw herself at the head of this poor
      devil and married him to hide her defeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, and made his life a burden until he is but the shadow of his
      former self. They started with a home of their own in Paris, and he kept
      two maids for her; still she called herself his servant. Although she was
      mistress over everything, she insisted that she was but his slave She
      neglected the house, the servants robbed them right and left, and he saw
      their home threatened with ruin without being able to move a finger to
      avert it. She opposed every suggestion he made; if he wanted black, she
      wanted white. In this way she broke his will and shattered, his nerves. He
      broke up his home and took her to a boarding-house to save her the trouble
      of housekeeping and enable her to devote herself entirely to her art. But
      she won&rsquo;t touch a brush and goes out all day long with her friend. She has
      tried to come between him and his work, too, and drive him to drink, but
      she has not managed it; therefore she hates him, for he is the better of
      the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the husband must be a fool,&rdquo; remarks the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fool wherever his wife is concerned, but he is no exception to
      the rule. They have been married for twelve years and he is still in love
      with her. The worst of it is that he is a strong man, who commanded the
      respect of Parliament and Press, is breaking up. I talked to him this
      morning; he is ill, to say the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I heard that she tried to have him locked up in a asylum, and that
      her friend did everything in her power to assist her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he works himself to death, so that she can enjoy herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why she treats him so contemptuously? Because he cannot give
      her all the luxury she wants. &lsquo;A man who cannot give his wife all she
      wants,&rsquo; she said the other day at dinner, &lsquo;ce n&rsquo;est pas grand&rsquo; chose.&rsquo; I
      believe that she counted on his booming her as an artist. Unfortunately
      his political views prevent him from being on good terms with the leading
      papers, and, moreover, he has no friends in artistic circles; his
      interests lie elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; she wanted to make use of him for her own ends; when he resisted
      she threw him over; but he serves his purpose as a breadwinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now, I, alone in silence and in pain,
  Weep for the ache of well-remembered bliss....
</pre>
    <p>
      comes her voice from the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; the sound came from behind the walnut tree. It was followed by a
      snapping of branches and a crunching of sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talkers jumped to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of a well-dressed man lay across the road, with his head against
      the leg of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song stopped abruptly. The ladies rushed into the garden. The friend
      poured a few drops of eau de Cologne which she held in her hand, on the
      face of the prostrate man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she realised that it was no fainting fit, she started back.
      &ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; she exclaimed, putting her hand up to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder of the two men, who was stooping over; the dead body, looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute!&rdquo; said the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead man&rsquo;s wife fainted, but was caught in the arms of her friend and
      tenderly nursed by the rest of the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for a doctor!&rdquo; shouted the elder of the two men. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody took any notice; everybody was busy with the unconscious wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bring such grief on his wife! Oh! what a man! What a man!&rdquo; sobbed the
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has no one a thought for the dying man? All this&rsquo; fuss because a woman
      has fainted! Give her some brandy, that will revive her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretched man has deserved his fate!&rdquo; said the friend emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He indeed deserved a better fate than to fall into your hands alive.
      Shame on you, woman, and all honour to the breadwinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let the hand of the dead man go and rose to his, feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; he said.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
